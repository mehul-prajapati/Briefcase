Free Electrons lab directory archive
------------------------------------

This is your training lab directory

To save space, we removed downloaded sources
(like the Linux kernel sources), but you could
download them again. Of course, we kept
your own source and generated files (kernel
configuration, kernel images, etc.), so that
you can easily reuse your work.

The command_history file contains a history
of the commands you typed during the labs.

The cross-compiling toolchain has been archived in toolchain.tar
To reuse it, extract it in /usr/local/xtools
