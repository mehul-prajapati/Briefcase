<h3>About this tutorial</h3>

<p> IP sockets are the lowest level layer upon which high level
          internet protocols are built--every thing from HTTP, to SSL, to
          POP3, to Kerberos, to UDP-Time. To implement custom protocols, or
          to customize implementation of well-known protocols, a programmer
          needs a working knowledge of the basic socket infrastructure. A
          similar API is available in many languages; this tutorial focuses
          primarily on C programming, but it also uses Python as a
          representative higher-level language for examples. </p>
<p> Readers of this tutorial will be introduced to the basics of
          programming custom network tools using the cross-platform Berkeley
          Sockets Interface.  Almost all network tools in Linux and other
          Unix-based operating systems rely on this interface. </p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p> This tutorial requires a minimal level of knowledge of C, and
          ideally of Python also (mostly for part two). However, readers who
          are not familiar with either programming language should be able
          to make it through with a bit of extra effort; most of the
          underlying concepts will apply equally to other programming
          languages, and calls will be quite similar in most high-level
          scripting languages like Ruby, Perl, TCL, etc. </p>
<p> While this tutorial introduces the basic concepts behind IP
          (internet protocol) networks, it certainly does not hurt readers
          to have some prior acquaintance with the concept of network
          protocols and layers. </p>

<h3>What is a network?</h3>

<p> What we usually call a computer network is composed of a number
          of  <a>"network layers"</a> , each providing a different restriction and/or
          guarantee about the data at that layer.  The protocols at each
          network layer generally have their own packet formats, headers,
          and layout. </p>
<p> The seven traditional layers of a network are divided into two
          groups: upper layers and lower layers.  The sockets interface
          provides a uniform API to the lower layers of a network, and
          allows you to implement upper layers within your sockets
          application.  Further, application data formats may themselves
          constitute further layers, e.g. SOAP is built on top of XML, and
          ebXML may itself utilize SOAP.  In any case, anything past layer 4
          is outside the scope of this tutorial. </p>

<h3>What do sockets do?</h3>

<p> While the sockets interface theoretically allows access to
           <i>protocol families</i>  other than IP, in practice, every network
          layer you use in your sockets application will use IP. For this
          tutorial we only look at IPv4; in the future IPv6 will become
          important also, but the principles are the same. At the transport
          layer, sockets support two specific protocols: TCP (transmission
          control protocol) and UDP (user datagram protocol). </p>
<p> Sockets cannot be used to access lower (or higher) network
          layers; for example, a socket application does not know whether it
          is running over ethernet, token ring, or a dialup connection. Nor
          does the sockets pseudo-layer know anything about higher-level
          protocols like NFS, HTTP, FTP, and the like (except in the sense
          that you might yourself write a sockets application that
          implements those higher-level protocols).  </p>
<p> At times, the sockets interface is not your best choice
          for a network programming API.  Specifically, many excellent
          libraries exist (in various languages) to use higher-level
          protocols directly, without having to worry about the details of
          sockets--the libraries handle those details for you.  While there
          is nothing wrong with writing your own SSH client, for example,
          there is not need to do so simply to let an application transfer
          data securely.  Lower-level layers than those sockets address fall
          pretty much in the domain of device driver programming. </p>

<h3>IP, TCP and UDP</h3>

<p> As the last panel indicated, when you program a sockets
           application, you have a choice to make between using TCP and
           using UDP.  Each has its own benefits and disadvantages. </p>
<p> TCP is a stream protocol, while UDP is a datagram protocol.
           That is to say, TCP establishes a continuous open connection
           between a client and a server, over which bytes may be
           written--and correct order guaranteed--for the life of the
           connection.  However, bytes written over TCP have no built-in
           structure, so higher-level protocols are required to delimit any
           data records and fields within the transmitted bytestream. </p>
<p> UDP, on the other hand, does not require that any connection
           be established between client and server, it simply transmits a
           message between addresses. A nice feature of UDP is that its
           packets are self-delimiting--each datagram indicates exactly
           where it begins and ends. A possible disadvantage of UDP,
           however, is that it provides no guarantee that packets will
           arrive in-order, or even at all.  Higher-level protocols built on
           top of UDP may, of course, provide handshaking and
           acknowledgements. </p>
<p> A useful analogy for understanding the difference between TCP
           and UDP is the difference between a telephone call and posted
           letters. The telephone call is not active until the caller "rings"
           the receiver and the receiver picks up. The telephone channel
           remains alive as long as the parties stay on the call--but they
           are free to say as much or as little as they wish to during the
           call. All remarks from either party occur in temporal order. On
           the other hand, when you send a letter, the post office starts
           delivery without any assurance the recipient exists, nor any
           strong guarantee about how long delivery will take. The recipient
           may receive various letters in a different order than they were
           sent, and the sender may receive mail interspersed in time with
           those she sends.  Unlike with the USPS, undeliverable mail
           always goes to the dead letter office, and is not returned to
           sender. </p>

<h3>Peers, ports, names, and addresses</h3>

<p> Beyond the protocol--TCP or UDP--there are two things a peer (a
         client or server) needs to know about the machine it communicates
         with: An IP address and a port. An IP address is a 32-bit data
         value, usually represented for humans in "dotted quad" notation,
         e.g.,  <code>64.41.64.172</code> . A port is a 16-bit data value,
         usually simply represented as a number less than 65536--most often
         one in the tens or hundreds range.  An IP address gets a packet
          <i>to</i>  a machine, a port lets the machine decide which
         process/service (if any) to direct it to.  That is a slight
         simplification, but the idea is correct. </p>
<p> The above description is almost right, but it misses something.
         Most of the time when humans think about an internet host (peer),
         we do not remember a number like  <code>64.41.64.172</code> , but
         instead a name like  <code>gnosis.cx</code> .  To find the IP address
         associated with a particular host name, usually you use a Domain
         Name Server, but sometimes local lookups are used first (often via
         the contents of  <code>/etc/hosts</code> ).  For this tutorial, we
         will generally just assume an IP address is available, but the next
         panel discusses coding name/address lookups. </p>

<h3>Host name resolution</h3>

<p> The command-line utility  <code>nslookup</code>  can be used to
          find a host IP address from a symbolic name.  Actually, a number
          of common utilities, such as  <code>ping</code>  or network
          configuration tools, do the same thing in passing.  But it is
          simple to do the same thing programmatically. </p>
<p> In Python or other very-high-level scripting languages, writing
          a utility program to find a host IP address is trivial: </p>
<pre> 
          #!/usr/bin/env python
          "USAGE: nslookup.py &lt;inet_address&gt;"
          import socket, sys
          print socket.gethostbyname(sys.argv[1])
           </pre>
<p> The trick is using a wrapped version of the same
           <code>gethostbyname())</code>  function we also find in C.  Usage
          is as simple as: </p>
<pre> 
          $ ./nslookup.py gnosis.cx
          64.41.64.172
           </pre>

<h3>Host name resolution, continued</h3>

<p> In C, that standard library call  <code>gethostbyname()</code> 
          is used for name lookup. The below is a simple implementation of
           <code>nslookup</code>  as a command-line tool; adapting it for use
          in a larger application is straightforward.  Of course, C is a
          bit more finicky than Python is. </p>
<pre> 
          /* Bare nslookup utility (w/ minimal error checking) */
          #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;          /* stderr, stdout */
          #include &lt;netdb.h&gt;          /* hostent struct, gethostbyname() */
          #include &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;      /* inet_ntoa() to format IP address */
          #include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;     /* in_addr structure */

          int main(int argc, char **argv) {
            struct hostent *host;     /* host information */
            struct in_addr h_addr;    /* internet address */
            if (argc != 2) {
              fprintf(stderr, "USAGE: nslookup &lt;inet_address&gt;\n");
              exit(1);
            }
            if ((host = gethostbyname(argv[1])) == NULL) {
              fprintf(stderr, "(mini) nslookup failed on '%s'\n", argv[1]);
              exit(1);
            }
            h_addr.s_addr = *((unsigned long *) host-&gt;h_addr_list[0]);
            fprintf(stdout, "%s\n", inet_ntoa(h_addr));
            exit(0);
          }
           </pre>
<p> Notice that the returned value from  <code>gethostbyname()</code> 
          is a  <code>hostent</code>  structure that describes the names host.
          The member  <code>host-&gt;h_addr_list</code>  contains a list of
          addresses, each of which is a 32-bit value in "network byte
          order"--i.e. the endianness may or may not be machine native
          order.  In order to convert to dotted-quad form, use the function
           <code>inet_ntoa()</code> . </p>

<h3>The steps in writing a socket client</h3>

<p> My examples for both clients and servers will use one of the
          simplest possible applications: one that sends data and receives
          the exact same thing back. In fact, many machines run an "echo
          server" for debugging purposes; this is convenient for our initial
          client, since it can be used before we get to the server portion
          (assuming you have a machine with  <code>echod</code>  running). </p>
<p> I would like to acknowledge the book  <i>TCP/IP Sockets in C</i> 
          by Donahoo and Calvert (see Resources). I have adapted several
          examples that they present. I recommend the book--but admittedly,
          echo servers/clients will come early in most presentations of
          sockets programming.  </p>
<p> The steps involved in writing a client application differ
          slightly between TCP and UDP clients. In both cases, you first
          create the socket; in the TCP case only, you next establish a
          connection to the server; next you send some data to the server;
          then receive data back; perhaps the sending and receiving
          alternates for a while; finally, in the TCP case, you close the
          connection.  </p>

<h3>A TCP echo client (client setup)</h3>

<p> First we will look at a TCP client, in the second part of the
          tutorial we will make some adjustments to do (roughly) the same
          thing with UDP.  Let's look at the first few lines--some
          includes, and creating the socket: </p>
<pre> 
          #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
          #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
          #include &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;
          #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
          #include &lt;string.h&gt;
          #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
          #include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;

          #define BUFFSIZE 32
          void Die(char *mess) { perror(mess); exit(1); }
           </pre>
<p> There is not too much to the setup. A particular buffer size is
          defined, which limits the amount of data echo'd at each pass
          (but we loop through multiple passes, if needed). . A small error
          function is also defined. </p>

<h3>A TCP echo client (creating the socket)</h3>

<p> The arguments to the  <code>socket()</code>  call decide the type
          of socket:  <code>PF_INET</code>  just means it uses IP (which you
          always will);  <code>SOCK_STREAM</code>  and  <code>IPPROTO_TCP</code> 
          go together for a TCP socket. </p>
<pre> 
          int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
            int sock;
            struct sockaddr_in echoserver;
            char buffer[BUFFSIZE];
            unsigned int echolen;
            int received = 0;

            if (argc != 4) {
              fprintf(stderr, "USAGE: TCPecho &lt;server_ip&gt; &lt;word&gt; &lt;port&gt;\n");
              exit(1);
            }
            /* Create the TCP socket */
            if ((sock = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP)) &lt; 0) {
              Die("Failed to create socket");
            }
           </pre>
<p> The value returned is a socket handle, which is similar to a
          file handle; specifically, if the socket creation fails, it will
          return -1 rather than a positive numbered handle. </p>

<h3>A TCP echo client (establish connection)</h3>

<p> Now that we have created a socket handle, we need to establish a
          connection with the server.  A connection requires a
           <code>sockaddr</code>  structure that describes the server.
          Specifically, we need to specify the server and port to connect to
          using  <code>echoserver.sin_addr.s_addr</code>  and
           <code>echoserver.sin_port</code> .  The fact we are using an IP
          address is specified with  <code>echoserver.sin_family</code> , but
          this will always be set to  <code>AF_INET</code> .
           </p>
<pre> 
            /* Construct the server sockaddr_in structure */
            memset(&amp;echoserver, 0, sizeof(echoserver));       /* Clear struct */
            echoserver.sin_family = AF_INET;                  /* Internet/IP */
            echoserver.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr(argv[1]);  /* IP address */
            echoserver.sin_port = htons(atoi(argv[3]));       /* server port */
            /* Establish connection */
            if (connect(sock,
                        (struct sockaddr *) &amp;echoserver,
                        sizeof(echoserver)) &lt; 0) {
              Die("Failed to connect with server");
            }
           </pre>
<p> As with creating the socket, the attempt to establish a
          connection will return -1 if the attempt fails. Otherwise, the
          socket is now ready to accept sending and receiving data.  </p>

<h3>A TCP echo client (send/receive data)</h3>

<p> Now that the connection is established, we are ready to send
          and receive data. A call to  <code>send()</code>  takes as 
          arguments the socket handle itself, the string to send, the 
          length of the sent string, and a flag argument. Normally the
          flag is the default value 0. The return value of the
           <code>send()</code>  call is the number of bytes successfully
          sent. </p>
<pre> 
            /* Send the word to the server */
            echolen = strlen(argv[2]);
            if (send(sock, argv[2], echolen, 0) != echolen) {
              Die("Mismatch in number of sent bytes");
            }
            /* Receive the word back from the server */
            fprintf(stdout, "Received: ");
            while (received &lt; echolen) {
              int bytes = 0;
              if ((bytes = recv(sock, buffer, BUFFSIZE-1, 0)) &lt; 1) {
                Die("Failed to receive bytes from server");
              }
              received += bytes;
              buffer[bytes] = '\0';        /* Assure null terminated string */
              fprintf(stdout, buffer);
            }
           </pre>
<p> The  <code>rcv()</code>  call is not guaranteed to get
          everything in-transit on a particular call--it simply blocks until
          it gets  <i>something</i> .  Therefore, we loop until we have gotten
          back as many bytes as were sent, writing each partial string as we
          get it.  Obviously, a different protocol might decide when to
          terminate receiving bytes in a different manner (perhaps a
          delimiter within the bytestream).  </p>

<h3>A TCP echo client (wrapup)</h3>

<p> Calls to both  <code>send()</code>  and  <code>recv()</code>  block
          by default, but it is possible to change socket options to allow
          non-blocking sockets. However, this tutorial will not cover details
          of creating non-blocking sockets, nor such other details used in
          production servers as forking, threading, or general asynchronous
          processing (built on non-blocking sockets).  </p>
<p> At the end of the process, we want to call  <code>close()</code> 
          on the socket, much as we would with a file handle </p>
<pre> 
           fprintf(stdout, "\n");
           close(sock);
           exit(0);
          }
          </pre>

<h2 align="center">Writing a Server Application in C</h2><hr>


<h3>The steps in writing a socket server</h3>

<p> A socket server is a bit more complicated than is a client,
          mostly because a server usually needs to be able to handle
          multiple client requests.  Basically, there are two aspects to a
          server: handling each established connection, and listening for
          connections to establish. </p>
<p> In our example, and in most cases, you can split the handling
          of a particular connection into support function--which looks
          quite a bit like a TCP client application does. We name that
          function  <code>HandleClient()</code> .  </p>
<p> Listening for new connections is a bit different from client
          code. The trick is that the socket you initially create and bind
          to an address and port is not the actually connected socket. This
          initial socket acts more like a socket factory, producing new
          connected sockets as needed. This arrangement has an advantage in
          enabling fork'd, threaded, or asynchronously dispatched handlers
          (using  <code>select()</code> ); however, for this first tutorial we
          will only handle pending connected sockets in synchronous order.
           </p>

<h3>A TCP echo server (application setup)</h3>

<p> Our echo server starts out with pretty much the same few
           <code>#include</code> s as the client did, and defines some
          constants and an error handling function: </p>
<pre> 
          #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
          #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
          #include &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;
          #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
          #include &lt;string.h&gt;
          #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
          #include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;

          #define MAXPENDING 5    /* Max connection requests */
          #define BUFFSIZE 32
          void Die(char *mess) { perror(mess); exit(1); }
           </pre>
<p> The  <code>BUFFSIZE</code>  constant limits the data sent per
          loop. The  <code>MAXPENDING</code>  constant limits the number of
          connections that will be queued at a time (only one will be
           <i>serviced</i>  at a time in our simple server). The
           <code>Die()</code>  function is the same as in our client. </p>

<h3>A TCP echo server (the connection handler)</h3>

<p> The handler for echo connections is straightforward.  All it
          does is receive any initial bytes available, then cycle through
          sending back data and receiving more data.  For short echo strings
          (particularly if less than  <code>BUFFSIZE</code> ) and typical
          connections, only one pass through the  <code>while</code>  loop
          will occur.  But the underlying sockets interface (and TCP/IP)
          does not make any guarantees about how the bytestream will be
          split between calls to  <code>recv()</code> . </p>
<pre> 
          void HandleClient(int sock) {
            char buffer[BUFFSIZE];
            int received = -1;
            /* Receive message */
            if ((received = recv(sock, buffer, BUFFSIZE, 0)) &lt; 0) {
              Die("Failed to receive initial bytes from client");
            }
            /* Send bytes and check for more incoming data in loop */
            while (received &gt; 0) {
              /* Send back received data */
              if (send(sock, buffer, received, 0) != received) {
                Die("Failed to send bytes to client");
              }
              /* Check for more data */
              if ((received = recv(sock, buffer, BUFFSIZE, 0)) &lt; 0) {
                Die("Failed to receive additional bytes from client");
              }
            }
            close(sock);
          }
           </pre>
<p> The socket that is passed in to the handler function is one
          that already connected to the requesting client.  Once we are done
          with echoing all the data, we should close this socket; the parent
          server socket stays around to spawn new children, like the one
          just closed. </p>

<h3>A TCP echo server (configuring the server socket)</h3>

<p> As we outlined before, creating a socket has a bit different
          purpose for a server than for a client. Creating the socket has
          the same syntax it did in the client; but the structure
           <code>echoserver</code>  is setup with information about the server
          itself, rather than about the peer it wants to connect to.
          You usually want to use the special constant
           <code>INADDR_ANY</code>  to enable receiving client request on any
          IP address the server supplies; in principle, such as in a
          multi-hosting server, you could specify a particular IP address
          instead. </p>
<pre> 
          int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
            int serversock, clientsock;
            struct sockaddr_in echoserver, echoclient;

            if (argc != 2) {
              fprintf(stderr, "USAGE: echoserver &lt;port&gt;\n");
              exit(1);
            }
            /* Create the TCP socket */
            if ((serversock = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP)) &lt; 0) {
              Die("Failed to create socket");
            }
            /* Construct the server sockaddr_in structure */
            memset(&amp;echoserver, 0, sizeof(echoserver));       /* Clear struct */
            echoserver.sin_family = AF_INET;                  /* Internet/IP */
            echoserver.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY);   /* Incoming addr */
            echoserver.sin_port = htons(atoi(argv[1]));       /* server port */
           </pre>
<p> Notice that both IP address and port are converted to network
          byte order for the  <code>sockaddr_in</code>  structure. The reverse
          functions to return to native byte order are  <code>ntohs()</code> 
          and  <code>ntohl()</code> . These functions are no-ops on some
          platforms, but it is still wise to use them for cross-platform
          compatibility. </p>

<h3>A TCP echo server (binding and listening)</h3>

<p> Whereas the client application  <code>connect()</code> 'd to a
          server's IP address and port, the server  <code>bind()</code> 's to
          its own address and port: </p>
<pre> 
          /* Bind the server socket */
          if (bind(serversock, (struct sockaddr *) &amp;echoserver,
                                       sizeof(echoserver)) &lt; 0) {
            Die("Failed to bind the server socket");
          }
          /* Listen on the server socket */
          if (listen(serversock, MAXPENDING) &lt; 0) {
            Die("Failed to listen on server socket");
          }
           </pre>
<p> Once the server socket is bound, it is ready to
           <code>listen()</code> .  As with most socket functions, both
           <code>bind()</code>  and  <code>listen()</code>  return -1 if they
          have a problem.  Once a server socket is listening, it is ready to
           <code>accept()</code>  client connections, acting as a factory for
          sockets on each connection. </p>

<h3>A TCP echo server (socket factory)</h3>

<p> Creating new sockets for client connections is the crux of a
          server.  The function  <code>accept()</code>  does two important
          things: it returns a socket pointer for the new socket; and it
          populates the  <code>sockaddr_in</code>  structure pointed to,
          in our case, by  <code>echoclient</code> . </p>
<pre> 
            /* Run until cancelled */
            while (1) {
              unsigned int clientlen = sizeof(echoclient);
              /* Wait for client connection */
              if ((clientsock =
                   accept(serversock, (struct sockaddr *) &amp;echoclient,
                          &amp;clientlen)) &lt; 0) {
                Die("Failed to accept client connection");
              }
              fprintf(stdout, "Client connected: %s\n",
                              inet_ntoa(echoclient.sin_addr));
              HandleClient(clientsock);
            }
          }
           </pre>
<p> We can see the populated structure in  <code>echoclient</code> 
          with the  <code>fprintf()</code>  call that accesses the client IP
          address.  The client socket pointer is passed to
           <code>HandleClient()</code> , which we saw at the start of this
          section. </p>

<h3>The socket and SocketServer module</h3>

<p> Python's standard module  <code>socket</code>  provides almost
          exactly the same range of capabilities you would find in C
          sockets.  However, the interface is generally more flexible,
          largely because of the benefits of dynamic typing.  Moreover, an
          object-oriented style is also used.  For example, once you create
          a socket object, methods like  <code>.bind()</code> ,
           <code>.connect()</code> , and  <code>.send()</code>  are methods of
          that object, rather than global functions operating on a socket
          pointer. </p>
<p> At a higher level than  <code>socket</code> , the module
           <code>SocketServer</code>  provides a framework for writing
          servers.  This is still relatively low level, and higher-level
          interfaces are available for server of higher-level protocols,
          e.g.  <code>SimpleHTTPServer</code> ,  <code>DocXMLRPCServer</code> ,
          or  <code>CGIHTTPServer</code> . </p>

<h3>A Python TCP echo client</h3>

<p> Let us just look at the complete client, then make a few
          remarks: </p>
<pre> 
          #!/usr/bin/env python
          "USAGE: echoclient.py &lt;server&gt; &lt;word&gt; &lt;port&gt;"
          from socket import *    # import *, but we'll avoid name conflict
          import sys
          if len(sys.argv) != 4:
              print __doc__
              sys.exit(0)
          sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
          sock.connect((sys.argv[1], int(sys.argv[3])))
          message = sys.argv[2]
          messlen, received = sock.send(message), 0
          if messlen != len(message):
              print "Failed to send complete message"
          print "Received: ",
          while received &lt; messlen:
              data = sock.recv(32)
              sys.stdout.write(data)
              received += len(data)
          print
          sock.close()
           </pre>
<p> At first brush, we seem to have left out some of the error
          catching code from the C version.  But since Python raises
          descriptive errors for every situation that we checked for in the
          C echo client, we can let the built-in exceptions do our work for
          us.  Of course, if we wanted the precise wording of errors that we
          had before, we would have to add a few
           <code>try</code> / <code>except</code>  clauses around the calls to
          methods of the socket object. </p>

<h3>A Python TCP echo client, continued</h3>

<p> While shorter, the Python client is somewhat more powerful.
          Specifically, the address we feed to a  <code>.connect()</code> 
          call can be either a dotted-quad IP address or a symbolic name,
          without need for extra lookup work, e.g.: </p>
<pre> 
          $ ./echoclient.py 192.168.2.103 foobar 7
          Received: foobar
          $ ./echoclient.py fury.gnosis.lan foobar 7
          Received: foobar
           </pre>
<p> We also have a choice between the methods  <code>.send()</code> 
          and  <code>.sendall()</code> .  The former sends as many bytes as it
          can at once, the latter sends the whole message (or raises an
          exception if it cannot).  For this client, we indicate if the
          whole message was not sent, but proceed with getting back as much
          as actually was sent. </p>

<h3>A Python TCP echo server (SocketServer)</h3>

<p> The simplest way to write a echo server in Python is using the
           <code>SocketServer</code>  module.  It is so easy as to almost seem
          like cheating.  In later panels, we will spell out the lower-level
          version, that follows the C implementation.  For now, let us see
          just how quick it can be: </p>
<pre> 
          #!/usr/bin/env python
          "USAGE: echoserver.py &lt;port&gt;"
          from SocketServer import BaseRequestHandler, TCPServer
          import sys, socket

          class EchoHandler(BaseRequestHandler):
              def handle(self):
                  print "Client connected:", self.client_address
                  self.request.sendall(self.request.recv(2**16))
                  self.request.close()

          if len(sys.argv) != 2:
              print __doc__
          else:
              TCPServer(('',int(sys.argv[1])), EchoHandler).serve_forever()
           </pre>
<p> The only thing we need to provide is a child of
           <code>SocketServer.BaseRequestHandler</code>  that has a
           <code>.handle()</code>  method. The  <code>self</code>  instance has
          some useful attributes, such as  <code>.client_address</code> , and
           <code>.request</code>  which is itself a connected socket object.
           </p>

<h3>A Python TCP echo server (socket)</h3>

<p> If we wish to do it "the hard way"--and gain a bit more
          fine-tuned control, we can write almost exactly our C echo server
          in Python (but in fewer lines): </p>
<pre> 
          #!/usr/bin/env python
          "USAGE: echoserver.py &lt;port&gt;"
          from socket import *    # import *, but we'll avoid name conflict
          import sys

          def handleClient(sock):
              data = sock.recv(32)
              while data:
                  sock.sendall(data)
                  data = sock.recv(32)
              sock.close()

          if len(sys.argv) != 2:
              print __doc__
          else:
              sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
              sock.bind(('',int(sys.argv[1])))
              sock.listen(5)
              while 1:    # Run until cancelled
                  newsock, client_addr = sock.accept()
                  print "Client connected:", client_addr
                  handleClient(newsock)
           </pre>
<p> In truth, this "hard way" still isn't very hard.  But as in the
          C implementation, we manufacture new connected sockets using
           <code>.listen()</code> , and call our handler for each such
          connection. </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p> The server and client presented in this tutorial are simple,
          but they show everything essential to writing TCP sockets
          applications.  If the data transmitted is more complicated, or the
          interaction between peers (client and server) is ore sophisticated
          in your application, that is just a matter of additional
          application programming.  The data exchanged will still follow the
          same pattern of  <code>connect()</code>  and  <code>bind()</code> ,
          then  <code>send()</code> 's and  <code>recv()</code> 's. </p>
<p> One thing this tutorial did not get to, except in brief
          summary at the start, is usage of UDP sockets.  TCP is more
          common, but it is important to also understand UDP sockets as an
          option for your application.  Part two of this tutorial will look
          at UDP, as well as implementing sockets applications in Python,
          and some other intermediate topics. </p>
