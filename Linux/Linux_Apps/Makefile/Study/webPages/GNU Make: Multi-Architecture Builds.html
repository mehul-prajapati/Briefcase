<h1><a name="other">Other Common Methods</a></h1>

<p> First we'll think about some other methods used for
multi-architecture builds, and discuss the pros and cons.  Ideally we'd
like a method that combined all the important advantages while avoiding
all the disadvantages.

</p><p> There are three main approaches to this problem that are most common:
the <dfn><b>Source Copy</b></dfn> method, the <dfn><b>Explicit
Path</b></dfn> method, and the <dfn><b>VPATH</b></dfn> method.


</p><h2><a name="sourcecopy">Source Copy Method</a></h2>

<p> This approach is fairly straightforward.  At its simplest, it's
merely a physical copy of the entire source tree for each separate build
type you want to create.  Every time you want to build, you copy the
sources to a new directory and build it there with whatever options you
require.  If you want to build it differently, copy the source to
another directory and repeat.

</p><p> The good point about this method is that makefiles are very simple
to write, read, and use.  The makefile creates the targets in the same
directory as the sources, which is very easy.  There is no need to
resort to VPATH or alternate directories at all.  Also, you can run
builds such as ``<code>make foo.o</code>'' and it works correctly.

</p><p> Unfortunately the downsides are more significant.  Suppose you
change a file; you must have some way of propagating those changes to
all the copies of the tree, for testing: managing this so you don't
forget one and wreck your build or, even worse, introduce odd bugs is
quite a challenge.  And of course, multiple versions of the entire
source tree uses quite a bit more disk space.  Note to mention the
"thumb-twiddling" time involved while waiting for the tree to copy in
the first place.


</p><h4>Symbolic Link Farms</h4>

<p> There is a flavor of the Source Copy method often used on UNIX
called the <dfn>symbolic link farm</dfn>.  The X Consortium, for
example, uses this flavor.  Here, a program or shell script is used to
first create a "shadow" directory hierarchy: a copy of the directory
structure is created, but no actual files are copied over.  Next,
instead of copying the source files themselves, the program or script
creates a symbolic link for each file from the "shadow" hierarchy back
to the "true" hierarchy.

</p><p> The symbolic link farm has the same advantages as the Source Copy,
and it ameliorates the worst of its disadvantages: since all but one of
the files are sym links you don't have to copy your changes around (but
you do have to be careful to edit the original, or set up your editor to
handle this situation properly--and some can't).  Link farm copies take
up considerably less space and are faster to create (though still not
free) than normal copies.

</p><p> Nevertheless, symlinks can be annoying to work with; a small
example: you need to remember to use the <code>-L</code> option to
<code>ls -l</code> when you want to see the size or modification time of
the actual file.  Also, adding new directories or files to the source
tree can be problematic: you need to remember to add them to the master
copy, and have a way of updating the links in all your farms.


</p><h2><a name="explicitpath">Explicit Path Method</a></h2>

<p> Better (IMO) than the previous one is the Explicit Path method.  You
might take a look at the final result in <a href="http://mad-scientist.net/make/vpath.html">How
<strong>Not</strong> to Use VPATH</a> for an example.  In this method,
you write your makefiles such that every reference to every target is
prefixed with the pathname where it exists.  For multiple architectures,
you merely change that pathname (it's obviously always stored in a
variable!)  The pathname can (and probably should) be calculated
internally to your makefiles based on the current host architecture, or
compiler flags, or both.

</p><p> Often the target directory is a simple subdirectory of the current
directory, but it could also be someplace completely different; this can
allow, for example, building sources that exist on read-only media
without copying them elsewhere first: the sources are left where they
sit, and the targets are put elsewhere, in a writable area.  If you
write your makefiles carefully you can easily accommodate both styles by
simply changing a variable value or two.

</p><p> Obviously since you're not copying sources anywhere, you avoid all
that hassle of remembering what to update, when.

</p><p> The problem here is with the makefiles.  First, they're more
difficult to read, write, and modify: every reference to every target
must be prefixed by some variable.  This can make for a lot of
redundancy in your makefiles.  Following
<a href="http://mad-scientist.net/make/rules.html#rule4">Paul's Fourth Rule of Makefiles</a> can
alleviate this, but it's still there.

Second, you cannot use simple rebuild commands like ``<code>make
foo.o</code>''; you must remember to prefix it with the target
directory, like ``<code>make '$(OBJDIR)/foo.o'</code>''.  This can get
unwieldy quickly.


</p><h2><a name="vpath">The VPATH Method</a></h2>

<p> Eh?  VPATH?  But didn't <a href="http://mad-scientist.net/make/vpath.html">we discover</a> that
VPATH wasn't useful for multi-architecture builds?  Well, not quite.  <a href="http://mad-scientist.net/make/rules.html#rule3">We decided</a> VPATH wasn't useful for locating
<em>targets</em>; however, it's extraordinarily handy for locating
<em>source</em> files.

</p><p> So, this method does just that.  Like the <a href="#sourcecopy">source copy method</a>, we write our makefiles to
create all targets in the current working directory.  Then, the makefile
uses VPATH to locate the source files for use, so we can write the
source filenames normally and without a path prefix either.

</p><p> Now all that has to be done is invoke the build from within the
<em>target</em> directory and voila!  It works.  The makefiles are tidy
and easy to understand, without pathnames prefixed everywhere.  You can
run builds using the simple ``<code>make foo.o</code>'' syntax.  And
you're not required to expend time or disk space creating multiple
copies of the source tree.

</p><p> The most popular example of this method are the build environments
created with a combination of GNU autoconf and GNU automake.  There, the
<code>configure</code> script is run from a remote directory and it sets
things up for you in that remote directory without modifying the
original sources.  Then you run a VPATH-capable <code>make</code>, such
as GNU <code>make</code>, and it uses VPATH to locate the source files
in the distribution directory, while writing the target files in the
directory where you invoked the build: the remote directory.

</p><h4> But wait a minute... </h4>

<p> Unfortunately, there's a painful thorn on this rosebush.  I glossed
over it above, but the phrase "invoke the build from within the
<em>target</em> directory" hides a not-insignificant annoyance for most
build environments.

</p><p> First, you have to <code>cd</code> to another directory from the one
you're editing in to actually invoke the build.  But even worse, the
makefile for your build is back in the source directory.  So, instead of
just typing ``<code>make</code>'', you need to run ``<code>make -f
SRC/Makefile</code>'' or similar.  Ugh.

</p><p> The GNU autoconf/automake tools avoid this latter issue by putting
the makefile in the target directory (the <code>configure</code> script
actually constructs it at configure time from a template contained in
the source directory).  Or, you could set up a symbolic link in the
target directory pointing back to the makefile in the source directory.
This can work, but it's still annoying and doesn't address the first
problem at all.


</p><h1><a name="advanced">The Advanced VPATH Method</a></h1>

<p> What would be really great is if we could combine the best parts of
<em>all</em> three of the above methods.  And why not?  Looking at them
again, the closest thing to what we really want is the <a href="#vpath">VPATH method</a>.  It's almost perfect.  What does it need
to make it just what we want?  Well, we need to avoid having to change
directories.  So, what the advanced VPATH method describes is a way of
convincing <code>make</code> itself to change directories <em>for</em>
you, rather than requiring you to do it yourself.

</p><p> The algorithm is simple: when <code>make</code> is invoked it checks
the current directory to see if the current directory is the target.  If
it's not, then <code>make</code> changes to the target directory and
re-invokes itself, using the <code>-f</code> option to point back to the
correct makefile from the source directory.  If <code>make</code> is in
the target directory, then it builds the requested targets.

</p><p> How can this be done?  It's not difficult, but it requires a few
tricky bits.  Basically, we enclose almost the entire makefile in an
<code>if-then-else</code> statement.  The test of the <code>if</code>
statement checks the current directory.  The <code>then</code> clause
jumps to the target directory.  The <code>else</code> clause contains
normal <code>make</code> rules, writing targets to the current
directory.  I use GNU <code>make</code>'s <code>include</code>
preprocessor feature to keep individual makefiles simpler-looking.

</p><h2><a name="single">Single Target Directory</a></h2>

<p> We'll start with the basic case: each source directory is completely
built in a single target directory.


</p><h3><a name="template">Standard Makefile Template</a></h3>

<p> Here's a sample makefile:

</p><div class="exbox">
 <div class="exboxtop"><div></div></div>
  <div class="exboxcontent">ifeq (,$(filter _%,$(notdir $(CURDIR))))
include target.mk
else
#----- End Boilerplate

VPATH = $(SRCDIR)

   <font color="green"><var>Normal makefile rules here</var></font>

#----- Begin Boilerplate
endif</div>
 <div class="exboxbottom"><div></div></div></div>

<p> Note the first and last sections are the same in every makefile.
The included file hides all the tricky bits from the casual user.  All
the user needs to do is create her makefile in the <em>Normal makefile
rules here</em> section, without worrying about where the targets go or
where the source files are.  These rules are written as if everything
occurs in the current directory.

</p><p> Let's go through this line-by-line:

</p><p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tbody><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="25%" align="left">
<code>ifeq (,$(filter _%,$(notdir $(CURDIR))))</code>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>
This is the moment of truth.  This tests whether or not we are already
in the target directory, or not.  Depending on the results of this test
<code>make</code> will see the rules in <code>target.mk</code>,
<em>or</em> it will see the rules the user has written in this makefile
(never both!).

<p> The test you use will likely depend on your environment.  The
example here is a very simple one: in this environment I have a rule
that all target directories will begin with an underscore
(<code>_</code>) and that no source directories will begin with an
underscore.  This is nice because it groups all the target directories
together and early in any directory listing, making them easy to find;
it is a simple rule everyone can follow and which could even be tested
for by triggers in your source control system to enforce; and it makes
testing whether we're in the target directory a simple matter of
checking the current directory name to see if it starts with an
underscore.

</p><p> Another common test would involve comparing the target directory
name with the current directory name, or some derivatives thereof.  In
this case, you need to compute the target directory name before the
<code>if</code>-statement.  In situations like that I prefer to
<code>include</code> another file before the <code>if</code>-statement,
say <code>include setup.mk</code>, that calculates the value of
$(OBJDIR).  Don't duplicate that calculation in every makefile, of
course!  However, it's simplest if you can come up with an easy rule
that can be tested merely by looking at the current directory itself.

<code>include target.mk</code>
</td><td>
The <code>target.mk</code> file contains all the super-magic bits that
make the entire thing work.  It is processed when (and only when) the
user invokes <code>make</code> in the source directory, and it's
responsible for inducing <code>make</code> to leap over into the
architecture directory and restart itself there.  See below for

Remember that this method relies on using VPATH to find the sources;

$(SRCDIR) to always contain the full path to the directory containing
the sources, so we are merely saying "anything you don't find here, look
for in $(SRCDIR)".

<p> Feel free to move this elsewhere (likely you have your own common
makefiles you want to include, for example), use <code>vpath</code>
instead, or whatever.  Just be sure that <em>somewhere</em> you tell

</p><p> Not too bad.  So, what's in this magical <code>target.mk</code> file?

</p><h3><a name="target.mk">The <code>target.mk</code> Makefile</a></h3>

<p> This file is where all the magical bits are hidden.  If make is
parsing this file, it means that the user invoked the build in the
source directory and we want to convince <code>make</code> to throw us
over into the target directory.  Of course, we want to preserve all the
same command line values the user provided, etc.!

</p><p> Here we go:

</p><div class="exbox">
 <div class="exboxtop"><div></div></div>
  <div class="exboxcontent">.SUFFIXES:

ifndef _ARCH
  _ARCH := $(shell print_arch)
  export _ARCH

OBJDIR := _$(_ARCH)

MAKETARGET = $(MAKE) --no-print-directory -C $@ -f $(CURDIR)/Makefile \
                 SRCDIR=$(CURDIR) $(MAKECMDGOALS)

.PHONY: clean

        rm -rf $(OBJDIR)</div>

</p><p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="25%" align="left">
<code>.SUFFIXES:</code>
</td><td>
This is the first magic bit.  This forces all (well, almost all) the
builtin rules to be removed.  This is crucial: we don't want
<code>make</code> to know how to build anything.  Below, we'll tell it
how to build everything, and we don't want it using any other rules.

<p> To be truly comprehensive, it's best to invoke <code>make</code>
with the <code>-r</code> option.  However, that usually means you need a
wrapper around <code>make</code> that users will run, so they don't
forget.  In my opinion a <code>make</code> wrapper script is a great
idea and I always use one, but opinions differ.

</p><p> Even if you do add <code>-r</code>, this line doesn't hurt.
</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2" valign="top" align="left">
<code>ifndef _ARCH<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;export _ARCH<br>
endif<br>
<br>
OBJDIR := _$(_ARCH)<br>
</code>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>
This section calculates the value of $(OBJDIR).  This example is a
little complicated; your version could be much simpler, as long as it
sets $(OBJDIR).

<p> Here, a variable <code>_ARCH</code> is initialized to the output of
a shell script <code>print_arch</code>.  That's just some script you can
knock off that uses <code>uname</code> or whatever is handy to determine
what type of system you're running on, then formats it into a simple
string (suitable for a directory name--no spaces, etc.)  and echos it.
Exactly what that means is up to your environment, of course.

</p><p> We try to gain a little efficiency by only invoking the shell once
per build invocation: only if $(_ARCH) is not already set do we invoke
the shell, and after it's set <code>make</code> exports the value into
the environment for sub-makes.  Note you need to be sure users don't
accidentally have <code>_ARCH</code> in their environments before they
invoke <code>make</code>--if you're worried about this either calculate
it every time (remove the <code>if</code>-statement), or use a
<em>really</em> obscure variable name (it must be a valid shell variable
name, though, or it won't be exported!)

</p><p> You may note I don't use <code>_ARCH</code> elsewhere in the
examples; it's left as a separate variable here because it can be handy
to have in user's makefiles.  For example, in the past I've used some
functions to transform the value into a C identifier, added
"<code>-D</code>" to the front, and stuck it into <code>CPPFLAGS</code>
for those times you just have to be system-specific.

</p><p> In this example I set $(OBJDIR) by simply adding an underscore to
the beginning of <code>_ARCH</code>, to give all the target directories
a common prefix that makes them simpler to find and manipulate.  You may
want to do more here: perhaps you want to differentiate the value of
<code>OBJDIR</code> based on flags (debugging vs. optimizing
vs. profiling, etc.)  Whatever specializations you want to make, though,
must be made here.

</p><p> In this example I have set the target directory to appear as simple
subdirectory of the source directory.  However, if you prefer,
<code>OBJDIR</code> could be a full or relative pathname instead.

This is merely a shorthand variable containing the actual make command
invoked to build in the target directory.  Briefly,
<code>--no-print-directory</code> is used to hide the fact that we're
jumping to the target directory; <code>-C $@</code> is used to run the
sub-make in the target directory; <code>-f $(CURDIR)/Makefile</code>
tells the sub-make where to find the makefile (remember that when we
invoke this we're in the source directory, so $(CURDIR) is the source
directory); <code>SRCDIR=$(CURDIR)</code> overrides the value of
<code>SRCDIR</code> in the sub-make to point to the source directory; and

This is the rule that actually does the relocation to the target
directory and invokes the sub-make there.  The first line merely ensures
the directory exists, and if it doesn't it's created.  I prefer to have
the target directories created by the build process, on the fly, rather
than having them pre-created in the source tree.  I think it's less
messy; much simpler to clean up (just delete the entire target
directory!); it's a useful hint as to what parts of the tree have been
built and for what architectures: just look and see what directories
exist; and finally, and most importantly, it means you don't need to go
through your source tree creating tons of new directories to add a new
architecture, or remove or rename an existing one.

<p> The second line, of course, invokes the make rule we described above.

</p><p> We use the <code>+</code> operator to ensure this jump is made even
when the <code>-n</code> option is given to make, and the <code>@</code>
operator to hide the clutter of the jump itself from the user.

</p><p> We use the directory name ($(OBJDIR)) as the target just as a
convenience; you can use the target name on the make invocation line and
it would work.  When dealing with multiple architecture directories in
one build (<a href="#multiple">see below</a>), that can be useful.

<code>Makefile : ;<br>

These lines are necessary, but not immediately obvious.  Below we're
going to define a rule that will tell <code>make</code> how to build
<em>any</em> target.  One thing GNU <code>make</code> always tries to do
is rebuild the makefile it's parsing, as well as any included
makefiles.  Normally this isn't a concern (aside, perhaps, from
efficiency concerns) because <code>make</code> doesn't know how to build
those files.  Without these lines, then, <code>make</code> will attempt
to rebuild the makefiles using the match-anything rule, invoking itself
recursively in the target directory!  Not good.

<p> These rules override that, by defining explicit empty commands to
build the Makefile and any other files ending in <code>.mk</code> (if
you use a different naming convention for makefiles you'll obviously
need to change the pattern rule above).
</p></td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top" width="25%" align="left">
<code>% :: $(OBJDIR) ; :</code>
</td><td>
This is the other extra-magic bit.  When <code>make</code> is invoked,
either without any targets (and the <code>all:</code> rule is chosen) or
with some targets on the command line, it will look for a rule to build
that target.  Above we've removed all builtin rules, and the
if-statement ensures that no rules the user wrote are visible here.  The
only option for <code>make</code> is this rule, so it always uses it.

<p> This is a "match anything" implicit rule.  The pattern, just
<code>%</code>, will match any target <code>make</code> wants to build.
We use the special double-colon (<code>::</code>) separator to specify
that this is a terminating "match anything" rule; this improves
efficiency.  See the GNU <code>make</code> manual for details on "match
anything" rules to understand this better.

</p><p> The "match anything" rule depends on the <code>$(OBJDIR)</code> rule.
That means that any target will first build the <code>$(OBJDIR)</code>
target, which will cause the sub-make to be invoked in the target
directory.  Once <code>make</code> builds the <code>$(OBJDIR)</code>
target once, it "knows" that target has been updated and won't try to
build it again for this invocation.  Since the <code>$(OBJDIR)</code>
target invokes the sub-make with all the command line goals, in
$(MAKECMDGOALS), that one invocation is enough to build all the targets
the user asked for.

</p><p> Quick note: why do we have "<code>:</code>" as the command to be
run?  That's the Bourne shell's "do nothing" operator.  GNU
<code>make</code> is actually smart enough to notice that your rule
consists of just the "do nothing" operator, and not exec a shell.  Why
don't we just use an empty command (a semicolon with nothing after it)?
We should be able to, but if you do then GNU <code>make</code> will
print a bunch of warnings about "nothing to do".  This is actually a bug
in GNU <code>make</code>, but this workaround does the job until it's
fixed.

While not strictly necessary, it's handy to put the <code>clean</code>
rules here.  By doing so we assure that they are invoked in the source
directory, and that we don't recurse into the target directory at all.

<p> In the environment used here, the target directory is created as
needed to hold derived object files, so there are never any source files
there.  Thus, the <code>clean</code> rule is quite simply to remove the
target directory and all of its contents!  This is most readily
accomplished from the source directory, rather than the target
directory, and saves us an extra invocation of <code>make</code> as
well.

</p><h2><a name="multiple">Multiple Target Directories</a></h2>

<p> Sometimes you'll want a single invocation of the build to create
files in multiple target directories.  A common example of this is
source code generators: in this case you want to build one set of
targets (the source code) in a common target directory that can be
shared by all architectures, then compile the source code into an
architecture-specific directory.  This can certainly be done with this
architecture, but it's slightly more complicated.

</p><p> In the example above we split the makefile into two parts with an
if-else statement: one part that was run when we were in the source
directory, and one part that was run when we were in the target
directory.  When we have multiple target directories, we need to split
the makefile into more than two parts: an extra part for each extra
target directory.  Then we'll jump to each target directory in order and
re-invoke make there.  In this example we'll stick with one extra target
directory, so we'll need three parts to the makefile.

</p><h3><a name="testingextra">Testing for Extra Target Directories</a></h3>

<p> The first complication that arises with multiple target directories
is, how do you decide if you have one or not?  If all your directories
have multiple targets, you're fine; you can modify
<code>target.mk</code> to jump to them in turn for all directories.
However, most often only a few directories will need an extra target
directory, and others won't.  You don't want to have extra invocations
of make in all your directories when most aren't useful, so somehow you
need to decide which directories have extra targets and which don't.

</p><p> The problem is, that information has to be specified in your
makefile <em>before</em> you include the <code>target.mk</code> file,
because that file is what needs to know.

</p><p> The simplest way is to have the extra target directory exist before
the build starts, then just have the <code>target.mk</code> test to see
if the directory exists.  The nice thing about this is it doesn't
require any special setup in the source makefiles, all the complexity
can be encapsulated in <code>target.mk</code>.  This is a good way to go
if the extra target directory is the same everywhere (which is often the
case)---for example, if it holds constructed source code that's common
between all architectures you might call it <code>_common</code>, then
test for that:

</p><pre>  EXTRATARGETS := $(wildcard _common)
</pre>

<p> Above I recommended against pre-creating target directories, but
this can be considered a special case: it will always need to exist
before any normal target can be built, so having it exist always isn't
as big of an issue.

</p><p> However, if you don't want the directory to pre-exist, or you can't
use this method for some other reason, the other option is to modify the
source makefile and set an EXTRATARGETS variable.  The minor
disadvantage here is that it must be done by the user, and it must be
set before the <code>if</code>-statement is invoked, meaning in the
boilerplate prefix section which is no longer quite so boilerplate.

</p><p> There are about as many possible ways to permute this as there are
requirements to do so; here I'm going to provide an example of a simple
case.

</p><h3><a name="multitemplate">Standard Makefile Template with Multiple Targets</a></h3>

<p> Here's an example of a standard source makefile for a directory that
has two targets: the <code>_common</code> target and the $(OBJDIR)
target.  This example assumes the first method of testing for the extra
target directory, done in <code>target.mk</code>.  If you choose another
method, you need to insert something before the first line below.

</p><div class="exbox">
 <div class="exboxtop"><div></div></div>
  <div class="exboxcontent">ifeq (,$(filter _%,$(notdir $(CURDIR))))
include target.mk
else
<font color="blue">ifeq (_common,$(notdir $(CURDIR)))

VPATH = $(SRCDIR)

.DEFAULT: ; @:

  <font color="green"><var>Makefile rules for _common files here</var></font>

else</font>

VPATH = $(SRCDIR)<font color="blue">:$(SRCDIR)/_common</font>

  <font color="green"><var>Makefile rules for $(OBJDIR) files here</var></font>

<font color="blue">endif</font>
endif</div>
 <div class="exboxbottom"><div></div></div></div>

<p> The new sections are in <font color="blue">blue text</font> above.
You can see what we've done: we've added another
<code>if</code>-statement into the target section of the makefile,
splitting it into two parts.  We execute the first part if we're in the
<code>_common</code> target directory, and the second part if we're in
the $(OBJDIR) target directory.

</p><p> In the <code>_common</code> target directory, we use VPATH to find
sources in the source directory.  In the $(OBJDIR) target directory, we
use VPATH to look in <em>both</em> the source directory <em>and</em> the
<code>_common</code> directory.

</p><p> There is one tricky bit here, the <code>.DEFAULT</code> rule.  This
rule, with a no-op command script, essentially tells make to ignore any
targets it doesn't know how to build.  This is necessary to allow
commands like "<code>make foo.o</code>" to succeed.  Remember that
regardless of the target you ask to be built, make will be invoked in
both the common and the target directories.  If you don't have this line
then when <code>make</code> tries to build <code>foo.o</code> in the
common directory, it will fail.  With this rule, it will succeed while
not actually doing anything, trusting the target directory invocation to
know what to do.  If that invocation fails you'll get a normal error,
since the <code>.DEFAULT</code> rule is only present in the section of
the makefile that's handling the common directory builds.

</p><p> If you have some common rules or variables that need to be set for
both the <code>_common</code> and the $(OBJDIR) target directories, you
can insert them between the first <code>else</code> and the second
<code>ifeq</code>, above; that section will be seen by both target
directory builds but not by the source directory build.

</p><p> Obviously this example is geared towards handling generated source
code; your need for multiple targets in the same build may be quite
different and not require this type of interaction.


</p><h3><a name="multitarget.mk">The <code>target.mk</code> File with Multiple Targets</a></h3>

<p> In the last section we saw how the user separates her rules into
different sections depending on which target directory is being built.
Let's see how to write a <code>target.mk</code> file that allows jumping
into multiple target directories.  It's fairly straightforward.

</p><div class="exbox">
 <div class="exboxtop"><div></div></div>
  <div class="exboxcontent">.SUFFIXES:

ifndef _ARCH
  _ARCH := $(shell print_arch)
  export _ARCH
endif

OBJDIR := _$(_ARCH)

MAKETARGET = $(MAKE) --no-print-directory -C $@ -f $(CURDIR)/Makefile \
                 SRCDIR=$(CURDIR) $(MAKECMDGOALS)

<font color="blue">EXTRATARGETS := $(wildcard _common)</font>

.PHONY: $(OBJDIR) <font color="blue">$(EXTRATARGETS)</font>
$(OBJDIR) <font color="blue">$(EXTRATARGETS)</font>:
        +@[ -d $@ ] || mkdir -p $@
        +@$(MAKETARGET)

<font color="blue">$(OBJDIR) : $(EXTRATARGETS)</font>

Makefile : ;
%.mk :: ;

% :: <font color="blue">$(EXTRATARGETS)</font> $(OBJDIR) ; :

.PHONY: clean
clean:
        <font color="blue">$(if $(EXTRATARGETS),rm -f $(EXTRATARGETS)/*)</font>
        rm -rf $(OBJDIR)</div>
 <div class="exboxbottom"><div></div></div></div>

<p> Again, additions to this file from the previous example are in
<font color="blue">blue text</font>.

</p><p> The first change sets the variable <code>EXTRATARGETS</code> to
<code>_common</code> if that directory exists, or empty if it doesn't.
If you are using a different method of determining the value of
$(EXTRATARGETS) you can change this line (or, leave it out if the source
makefile is setting it for you).

</p><p> Next, we include the value of $(EXTRATARGETS) (if any) as a phony
target to be built, and use the same sub-make invocation rule for
building it as we use for $(OBJDIR).

</p><p> Next we declare a dependency relationship between $(OBJDIR) and
$(EXTRATARGETS) (if it exists) to ensure that $(EXTRATARGETS) is built
first; in our environment that's what we want since $(OBJDIR) depends on
the results of that build.  If your situation is different, you can omit
or modify this line.  However, <em>if</em> there is a dependency between
these two you must declare it.  Otherwise, <code>make</code> might do
the wrong thing, especially in the presence of a parallel build
situation.

</p><p> We add $(EXTRATARGETS) to the prerequisite line for the
match-anything rule.  In this case, since we declared the dependency
relationship above, we could have omitted this and achieved the same
result.

</p><p> Finally, if $(EXTRATARGETS) exists we remove its contents during the
<code>clean</code> rule.  Remember that in this scenario the presence or
absence of the <code>_common</code> directory is what notifies us that
there is an extra target directory, so we must be careful not to remove
the directory itself, only its contents.  The <code>if</code>-statement
will expand to an empty string if $(EXTRATARGETS) doesn't exist.

</p><h2><a name="sample">Sample Implementation</a></h2>

<p> You can download a very small sample implementation of the above
method <a href="http://mad-scientist.net/make/multi-example.tar.gz">right here</a>.  Uncompress and
untar the file, then change to the <code>example</code> directory and
run <code>make</code>.

</p><p> This trivial example merely transforms a <code>version.c.in</code>
file into an <code>_common/version.c</code> file, using <code>sed</code>
to install a version number.  Then it creates an executable in the
target directory:

</p><div class="exbox">
 <div class="exboxtop"><div></div></div>
  <div class="exboxcontent">example$ <b>make</b>
sed 's/@VERSION@/1.0/g' /tmp/example/version.c.in &gt; version.c
cc     /tmp/example/_common/version.c   -o version

example$ <b>ls _*</b>
_Linux:
version

_common:
version.c

example$ <b>_Linux/version</b>
The version is `1.0'.</div>
 <div class="exboxbottom"><div></div></div></div>

<p> Now, if you override <code>OBJDIR</code> to have a different value
you can see that <code>version.c</code> is not recreated, as it's common
between all the targets, but a new <code>version</code> binary is built:

</p><div class="exbox">
 <div class="exboxtop"><div></div></div>
  <div class="exboxcontent">example$ <b>make OBJDIR=_Test</b>
cc     /tmp/example/_common/version.c   -o version

example$ <b>ls _*</b>
_Linux:
version

_Test:
version

_common:
version.c

example$ <b>_Test/version</b>
The version is `1.0'.</div>
 <div class="exboxbottom"><div></div></div></div>


<h1><a name="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</a></h1>

<ul>
<p></p><li> When I was first developing this idea back in 1991/1992, I
bounced a number of questions off of Roland McGrath: his responses were
very helpful.

<p></p></li><li> The enhancement for using $(MAKECMDGOALS) and the match-anything
rule (instead of <code>.DEFAULT</code> as in the previous version of
this document) was suggested to me via email by Jacob Burckhardt
&lt;bjacob@ca.metsci.com&gt;.  This also prodded me to revise and
complete this document: when I wrote it originally $(MAKECMDGOALS)
didn't exist, and I wondered what other features added since the
original version could be useful in this method.

<!--  <p><li> The suggestion for having a script change to the target directory, -->
<!--  then invoke make, rather than having the makefile do so was made to me -->
<!--  via email by James Ganong &lt;jeg@bigseal.ucsc.edu&gt;. -->
</li></ul>

<p> Thanks to all!
