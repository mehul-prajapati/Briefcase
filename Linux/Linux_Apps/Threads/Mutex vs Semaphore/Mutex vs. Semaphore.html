<h1>Mutex vs. Semaphore, what is the difference?</h1>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Toilet Example&nbsp; (c) Copyright&nbsp;2005, Niclas Winquist ;)<br>

<br>

</span>Mutex:</span><br>

<br>

Is a key to a toilet. One person can have the key - occupy the toilet -
at the time. When finished, the person gives (frees) the key to the
next person in the queue.<br>

<br>

Officially: "Mutexes are typically used to serialise access to a
section of &nbsp;re-entrant code that cannot be executed concurrently
by more than one thread. A mutex object only allows one thread into a
controlled section, forcing other threads which attempt to gain access
to that section to wait until the first thread has exited from that
section."<br>

<br>

(A mutex is really a semaphore with value 1.)    <font color="red">(*</font>


<br>
<br>
<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Semaphore:</span><br>

<br>

Is the number of free identical toilet keys. Example, say we have four
toilets with identical locks and keys. The semaphore count - the count of
keys - is set to 4 at beginning (all four toilets are free), then the count value is
decremented as people are coming in. If all toilets are full, ie. there
are no free keys left,&nbsp;the semaphore count is 0. Now, when eq. one person leaves
the toilet, semaphore is increased&nbsp;to 1 (one free key), and given to the next
person in the queue.<br>

<br>

Officially: "A semaphore restricts the number of simultaneous users of
a shared resource up to a maximum number. Threads can request access to
the resource (decrementing the semaphore), and can signal that they
have finished using the resource (incrementing the semaphore)."<br>
