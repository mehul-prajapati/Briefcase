<p>
An <i>X server</i> is a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/program.html">program</a> in the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/x.html"><i>X Window System</i></a> that runs on <a href="http://www.linfo.org/local_machine.html"><i>local machines</i></a>
 (i.e., the computers used directly by users) and  handles all access to
 the graphics cards, display screens and input devices (typically a 
keyboard and mouse) on those computers. 
</p>

<p>
The X Window System, often referred to merely as <i>X</i>, is a complete, <a href="http://www.linfo.org/cross-platform.html">cross-platform</a> and <a href="http://www.linfo.org/free_software.html">free</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/client_server.html"><i>client-server</i></a> system for managing <a href="http://www.linfo.org/gui.html">GUIs</a> (graphical user interfaces) on single computers and on <a href="http://www.linfo.org/network.html">networks</a> of computers. The client-server model is an <i>architecture</i> (i.e., network design) that divides the work between two separate but linked applications, referred to as <a href="http://www.linfo.org/client.html"><i>clients</i></a> and <a href="http://www.linfo.org/server.html"><i>servers</i></a>.
</p>

<p>
In the typical client-server relationship, the client application runs 
on the local machine. It helps the user request data from the server and
 displays the requested data appropriately on the user's display screen.
 The server application, which processes the data as requested and 
returns the results to the client, typically can run on either a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/remote_machine.html"><i>remote machine</i></a> (i.e., a computer located elsewhere on the network) or the local machine with no obvious difference to the user (so-called <a href="http://www.linfo.org/network_transparency.html"><i>network transparency</i></a>). When running on a remote machine, the server program can accommodate the requests of multiple clients.
</p>

<p>
In X, however. the client-server relationship is inverted in that each 
local machine contains X server server software and can access <a href="http://www.linfo.org/x_client.html"><i>X clients</i></a> (i.e., <a href="http://www.linfo.org/appslist.html">application programs</a>)
 that run either on the same machine or on a remote machine. The X 
server does the actual work of managing the input and display devices, 
including performing the requested display operation. This has the 
advantage of eliminating the need for the application programs to be 
aware of these hardware details, thereby simplifying the development of 
such programs and facilitating their servicing of multiple users on the 
network simultaneously.   
</p>

<p>
Communication between an X server and X clients is governed by the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/x_protocol.html"><i>X protocol</i></a>, which is sometimes termed <i>the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/message.html">message</a> format of the X Window System</i>. Such communication consists of: (1) requests by clients for <a href="http://www.linfo.org/information.html">information</a> or an action, (2) responses by the server, (3) the sending by the server of <i>events</i> to clients and (4) the sending by the server of error <a href="http://www.linfo.org/packet.html"><i>packets</i></a> if client requests are invalid. An event is typically an input from a keyboard or mouse, such as a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/window.html">window</a>
 being moved, exposed, resized or closed. Packets are the fundamental 
unit of information transport in all modern computer networks.
</p>

<p>
The X server provides five basic types of services: input handling, 
window services, graphics, text and fonts, and resource management. 
Input handling services consist of passing keyboard and mouse inputs to 
clients as events via the <i>window manager</i>, which X regards as just
 another client. A window manager is a program that provides basic 
management operations for windows, such as opening, closing, moving and 
resizing windows.
</p>

<p>
Window services are requests by clients to the X server to provide 
information about windows or to create or destroy them. Graphics 
services are the drawing of lines and shapes and performing <i>bitmap</i> (i.e., images made up of <a href="http://www.linfo.org/pixel.html">pixels</a>)
 operations in response to client requests. Text and font services are 
responses to clients' requests to draw text at specified locations in 
specific fonts as well as responses to requests for information on 
available fonts. Resource management includes the provision of a 
content-addressable database for clients.
