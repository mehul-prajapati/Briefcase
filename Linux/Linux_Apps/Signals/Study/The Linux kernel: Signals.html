<h2><a name="s5">5.</a> Signals</h2>

<p>The common communication channel between user space program and
kernel is given by the system calls. But there is a different channel,
that of the <i>signals</i>, used both between user processes
and from kernel to user process.</p>

<h2><a name="ss5.1">5.1</a> Sending signals
</h2>

<p>A program can signal a different program using the <code>kill()</code>
system call with prototype
</p><blockquote>
<pre>int kill(pid_t pid, int sig);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>This will send the signal with number <code>sig</code> to the process
with process ID <code>pid</code>. Signal numbers are small positive integers.
(For the definitions on your machine, try <code>/usr/include/bits/signum.h</code>.
Note that these definitions depend on OS and architecture.)</p>
<p>A user can send a signal from the command line using the <code>kill</code>
command. Common uses are <code>kill -9</code> <i>N</i> to kill the process
with pid <i>N</i>, or <code>kill -1</code> <i>N</i>
to force process <i>N</i> (maybe <code>init</code> or <code>inetd</code>)
to reread its configuration file.</p>
<p>Certain user actions will make the kernel send a signal to a process
or group of processes: typing the interrupt character (probably Ctrl-C)
causes SIGINT to be sent, typing the quit character (probably
Ctrl-\) sends SIGQUIT, hanging up the phone (modem) sends SIGHUP,
typing the stop character (probably Ctrl-Z) sends SIGSTOP.</p>
<p>Certain program actions will make the kernel send a signal to that process:
for an illegal instruction one gets SIGILL, for accessing nonexisting
memory one gets SIGSEGV, for writing to a pipe while nobody is listening
anymore on the other side one gets SIGPIPE, for reading from the termnal
while in the background one gets SIGTTIN, etc.</p>
<p>More interesting communication from the kernel is also possible.
One can ask the kernel to be notified when something happens
on a given file descriptor. See fcntl(2).
And then there is ptrace(2) - see below.</p>
<p>A whole group of signals is reserved for real-time use.</p>

<h2><a name="ss5.2">5.2</a> Receiving signals
</h2>

<p>When a process receives a signal, a default action happens, unless
the process has arranged to handle the signal. For the list of
signals and the corresponding default actions, see signal(7).
For example, by default SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGKILL will kill the process;
SIGQUIT will kill the process and force a core dump;
SIGSTOP, SIGTTIN will stop the process;
SIGCONT will continue a stopped process;
SIGCHLD will be ignored.</p>
<p>Traditionally, one sets up a handler for the signal using
the <code>signal</code> system call with prototype
</p><blockquote>
<pre>typedef void (*sighandler_t)(int);
sighandler_t signal(int sig, sighandler_t handler);
</pre>
</blockquote>

This sets up the routine <code>handler()</code> as handler for signals
with number <code>sig</code>. The return value is (the address of)
the old handler. The special values SIG_DFL and SIG_IGN denote the
default action and ignoring, respectively.<p></p>
<p>When a signal arrives, the process is interrupted, the current
registers are saved, and the signal handler is invoked.
When the signal handler returns, the interrupted activity is
continued.</p>
<p>It is difficult to do interesting things in a signal handler,
because the process can be interrupted in an arbitrary place,
data structures can be in arbitrary state, etc.
The three most common things to do in a signal handler are
(i) set a flag variable and return immediately, and (ii) (messy)
throw away all the program was doing, and restart at some
convenient point, perhaps the main command loop or so, and (iii)
clean up and exit.</p>
<p>Setting up a handler for a signal is called "catching the signal".
The signals SIGKILL and SIGSTOP cannot be caught or blocked or ignored.</p>

<h2><a name="ss5.3">5.3</a> Semantics
</h2>

<p>The traditional semantics was: reset signal behaviour to SIG_DFL upon
invocation of the signal handler. Possibly this was done to avoid
recursive invocations. The signal handler would do its job and
at the end call <code>signal()</code> to establish itself again as handler.</p>
<p>This is really unfortunate. When two signals arrive shortly after
each other, the second one will be lost if it arrives before
the signal handler is called - there is no counter.
And if it arrives after the signal handler is called, the
default action will happen - this may very well kill the process.
Even if the handler calls <code>signal()</code> again as the very first
thing it does, that may be too late.</p>
<p>Various Unix flavours played a bit with the semantics to improve
on this situation. Some block signals as long as the process has not
returned from the handler. The BSD solution was to invent a new
system call, <code>sigaction()</code> where one can precisely specify
the desired behaviour. Today <code>signal()</code> must be regarded
as deprecated - not to be used in serious applications.</p>

<h2><a name="ss5.4">5.4</a> Blocking signals
</h2>

<p>Each process has a list (bitmask) of currently blocked signals.
When a signal is blocked, it is not delivered (that is,
no signal handling routine is called), but remains pending.</p>
<p>The <code>sigprocmask()</code> system call serves to change
the list of blocked signals. See sigprocmask(2).</p>
<p>The <code>sigpending()</code> system call reveals what signals
are (blocked and) pending.</p>
<p>The <code>sigsuspend()</code> system call suspends the calling process
until a specified signal is received.</p>
<p>When a signal is blocked, it remains pending, even when otherwise
the process would ignore it.</p>

<h2><a name="ss5.5">5.5</a> Voodoo: wait and SIGCHLD
</h2>

<p>When a process forks off a child to perform some task, it is probably
interested in how things went. Upon exit, the child leaves an exit status
that should be returned to the parent.
So, when the child finishes it becomes
a <i>zombie</i> - a process that is dead already but does not disappear
yet because it has not yet reported its exit status.</p>
<p>Whenever something interesting happens to the child
(it exits, crashes, traps, stops, continues),
and in particular when it dies, the parent is sent a SIGCHLD signal.</p>
<p>The parent can use the system call <code>wait()</code> or <code>waitpid()</code>
or so, there are a few variations, to learn about the status of its
stopped or deceased children. In the case of a deceased child, as soon as
a status has been reported, the zombie vanishes.</p>
<p>If the parent is not interested it can say so explicitly (before the fork)
using
</p><blockquote>
<pre>signal(SIGCHLD, SIG_IGN);
</pre>
</blockquote>

or
<blockquote>
<pre>struct sigaction act;
act.sa_handler = something;
act.sa_flags = SA_NOCLDWAIT;
sigaction (SIGCHLD, &amp;act, NULL);
</pre>
</blockquote>

and as a result it will not hear about deceased children,
and children will not be transformed into zombies.
Note that the default action for SIGCHLD is to ignore this signal;
nevertheless <code>signal(SIGCHLD, SIG_IGN)</code> has effect, namely
that of preventing the transformation of children into zombies.
In this situation, if the parent does a <code>wait()</code>, this call
will return only when all children have exited, and then returns -1
with <i>errno</i> set to ECHILD.<p></p>
<p>It depends on the Unix flavor whether SIGCHLD is sent when
SA_NOCLDWAIT was set. After <code>act.sa_flags = SA_NOCLDSTOP</code>
no SIGCHLD is sent when children stop or stopped children continue.</p>
<p>If the parent exits before the child, then the child is reparented
to <code>init</code>, process 1, and this process will reap its status.</p>

<h2><a name="ss5.6">5.6</a> Returning from a signal handler
</h2>

<p>When the program was interrupted by a signal, its status (including
all integer and floating point registers) was saved, to be restored
just before execution continues at the point of interruption.</p>
<p>This means that the return from the signal handler is more complicated
than an arbitrary procedure return - the saved state must be restored.</p>
<p>To this end, the kernel arranges that the return from the signal handler
causes a jump to a short code sequence (sometimes called <i>trampoline</i>)
that executes a <code>sigreturn()</code> system call. This system call takes
care of everything.</p>
<p>In the old days the trampoline lived on the stack, but nowadays (since 2.5.69)
we have a trampoline in the 
<a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/%7Eaeb/linux/lk/lk-4.html#vsyscall">vsyscall</a> page,
so that this trampoline no longer is an obstacle in case one wants a
non-executable stack.</p>

<h2><a name="ss5.7">5.7</a> ptrace
</h2>

<p>For debugging purposes, the <code>ptrace()</code> system call was
introduced. A process can trace a different process, examine or
change its memory, see the system calls done or change them, etc.
The way this is implemented is that the tracing process is notified
each time the traced process does something interesting. Always
interesting is the reception of signals. When the tracing process
specifies this, also excution of system calls, or execution of any
instruction is interesting.</p>
<p>Thus, one has interactive debuggers like <code>gdb</code>, and tracers
like <code>strace</code>. This call is also very useful for hacking
purposes. One can make one's own program attach to some utility
and subtly change its workings, while the binary of the utility
is unchanged, still has the correct date stamps and md5sum.</p>
<p><b>Exercise</b> <i>Write a program that attaches itself to a
process with specified pid, and watches its read() calls;
whenever a specified string occurs, change it into something else.
Be otherwise invisible.</i></p>
<p><b>Exercise</b> <i>Write a program that attaches itself to a shell
and watches the commands given. Whenever a specified binary must
be executed, execute a different specified binary instead.
Be otherwise invisible.</i></p>
<p>Below a 
<a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/%7Eaeb/linux/lk/ptrace.c">baby example</a> of the use
of ptrace. This program will list the system calls done by some
existing process (call <code>./ptrace -p</code> <i>N</i>) or some
subprocess (call <code>./ptrace some_command</code>, e.g.,
<code>./ptrace /bin/ls -l</code>).
The version below will work only on i386, and only for relatively
recent kernels.</p>

<p>A tracee gets sent a SIGTRAP signal (and stops) when it successfully does an
<code>execve</code> system call. This means that we see <code>execve</code>
three times (on exit, on return, on SIGTRAP). This signal can be used
to synchronize on, instead of the above complicated SIGUSR1 construction.</p>


<h2><a name="ss5.8">5.8</a> The Linux "parent death" signal
</h2>

<p>For each process there is a variable <code>pdeath_signal</code>,
that is initialized to 0 after fork() or clone().
It gives the signal that the process should get when its parent dies.</p>
<p>This variable can be set using
</p><pre>        prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG, sig);
</pre>

and read out using
<pre>        prctl(PR_GET_PDEATHSIG, &amp;sig);
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>This construct can be used in thread libraries: when the
manager thread dies, all threads managed by it should
clean up and exit. E.g.:
</p><pre>        prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG, SIGHUP);        /* set pdeath sig */
        if (getppid() == 1)                     /* parent died already? */
                kill(getpid(), SIGHUP);
</pre>
<p></p>
