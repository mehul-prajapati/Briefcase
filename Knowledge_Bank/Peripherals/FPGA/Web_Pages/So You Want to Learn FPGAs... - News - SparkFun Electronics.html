  <hr>

  <p>Like most engineers, I was first introduced to FPGAs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">Field-Programmable Gate Arrays</a>)
 in college. By that time I was already experienced with programming, 
logic and circuit design, but even with those subjects under my belt, I 
found FPGAs wildly confusing. For a long time after taking that FPGA 
course, I was convinced that I could have developed a better course than
 my professor, and blamed most of my initial confusion on that. I felt 
that way right up until I tried to do exactly what my professor did: 
teach FPGAs.</p>

<p>On the surface, it seems like someone with lots of microcontroller 
experience would have no problem migrating to the world of programmable 
logic, but that is simply not the case. Even the most experienced 
programmer and developer will have problems understanding the concept 
behind things like “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprocedural_language">non-procedural programming</a>.”
 Just the concept of a circuit being “written” in a language like VHDL 
rather than built is enough to confuse the average DIYer.</p>

<p>As an engineer at SparkFun, it is my job to provide the “shortcuts” 
that a hobbyist or student might need to accomplish their goals in the 
electronic realm. So awhile ago, I set about trying to write a tutorial 
that would provide the base information and tools needed to get someone 
started using FPGAs. After ten pages of writing, I realized that 
teaching the concepts needed to understand and use an FPGA is a much 
bigger problem than I anticipated. In fact, it’s such a large and 
complex problem that, after a couple of years, I <em>still</em> haven’t found a complete way to introduce the uninitiated to the world of FPGAs.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="http://embeddedmicro.com/tutorials/mojo"><img src="So%20You%20Want%20to%20Learn%20FPGAs...%20-%20News%20-%20SparkFun%20Electronics_files/51decacece395f0b2f000000.jpg" alt="alt text"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><em>The Mojo V3</em></p>

<p>Luckily the DIY world has lots of very talented people working on the
 very same problem. In particular, Jack Gassett, the creator of the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11838">Papilio</a>, and Justin Rajewski, creator of the <a href="http://embeddedmicro.com/tutorials/mojo">Mojo</a> have done the some great work creating boards and material to ease the transition into the world of FPGAs.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11838"><img src="So%20You%20Want%20to%20Learn%20FPGAs...%20-%20News%20-%20SparkFun%20Electronics_files/51decacece395f9d2e000000.jpg" alt="alt text"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Papilio Pro LX9</em></p>

<p>Both of these boards have a great deal of supporting information and 
tutorials that make them a perfect choice if one has a bit of 
electronics experience and wants to start working with FPGAs. The 
Papilio has tutorials at the <a href="http://papilio.cc/">Papilio</a> site, and the Mojo has tutorials at the <a href="http://embeddedmicro.com/tutorials/mojo">Embedded Micro</a> site.</p>

<p>Now, I don’t want you to think that this post is meant to be an 
advertisement for these two boards. They’re great devices, but this post
 is meant to shine light on a massive gap in the open source community. 
To this day FPGAs are still <em>very, very, difficult to learn and teach.</em>
 There are people who want to learn logic and FPGAs that are turned off 
of the subject because the barrier to entry is still so high. It’s the 
open source community’s responsibility to lower that barrier to entry, 
but so far, it’s still high enough to scare away even seasoned 
electronics enthusiasts.</p>

<p>So what’s to be done? Personally, I don’t really have a good answer. 
People like Jack Gassett and Justin Rajewski have bravely taken up the 
cause of bringing FPGAs to the masses, but there is still much to be 
done. It will still be a while (or never) until FPGAs are as friendly 
as, say, the Arduino, but with enough talented geeks attacking the 
problem, we can at least make programmable logic less scary.</p>

<p>So what do you think the next step is? What would make FPGAs easier 
to learn and use? If you’re already a developer, what made your learning
 experience easier?</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Working in the FPGA industry for 2 years, I always learn something new every day.</p>

<p>To really learn FPGAs well, you really gotta start with the very 
basics. Logic blocks/designs, and then translate those basic blocks into
 HDL (Hardware Descriptive Language) code.</p>

<p>From here, it’s not really about learning the FPGA itself, but more 
on the software that you need to use the program the chip. As people in 
the IRC channel know, I am more than willing to demo HDL and the FPGA 
design process using my Justin.tv account. People that watch do learn 
things, and I try to make it as interactive as possible. I’m there to 
teach people, not do marketing demos.</p>

<p>I personally think that Sparkfun should do something like the SIK, 
and do the SFIK (Sparkfun FPGA Inventor’s Kit). Where you start off with
 the logic block boards, then go to a Papilio/Papilio Pro/Mojo v3 board.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I’m a bit biased being an FPGA designer 
myself, but I think getting FPGAs out there would be awesome.  They are 
incredibly powerful pieces of hardware.  Think of them as having the 
potential to be 100,000+ core processors which happen to run Finite 
State Machines rather than Machine Code.</p>

<p>From my experience I think there are 4 major barriers to FPGAs:</p>

<p>1) State Machines.  I know a lot of us know what they are, but for 
someone coming into digital through Arduinos they are a key piece that 
gets missed.  I think a basic course in digital focusing on discrete 
logic would help.  Ultimately that is all an FPGA is really.  I would 
suggest a class/tutorial that goes through State Machines and how to 
build logic with discrete chips would help.  That is how I learned, and I
 constantly find myself doing mental comparisons of what is happening in
 code to what we did with discrete logic.  Maybe Pete could give us a 
video on FSMs…</p>

<p>2) Parallelized Hardware Coding.  FPGAs are a totally different beast
 when it comes to programming.  I learned the basics in my Digital Logic
 class using the Altera schematic editor.  This lets you drag and drop 
in basic logic blocks and wire them together.  Once you understand how 
to build a circuit with FSMs like in number 1, then FPGA design with a 
schematic editor tool fairly easy to grasp.  Then once you get the hang 
of wiring together blocks, you can start converting some or all of it to
 code, and see exactly how the circuit becomes code (at least I seem to 
remember being able to do that…).  I think something that may help break
 the programming barrier would be something like an open source library 
of little code blocks (like the massive amount of example code that is 
available for Arduino).  This would let people grab say a UART or a SPI 
interface, and drop it into their design saving them the expertise 
needed to do more complex tasks.  Learning to wire together code blocks,
 and begin to modify them to do what you want is a great way to ease 
into the FPGA world.  That is basically how I went from absolute noob to
 an FPGA designer, was working with predeveloped code and breaking it 
down and piecing it together.</p>

<p>3) SMD only.  I know a lot of people are getting into SMD soldering, 
but FPGAs tend to be relatively fine pitch, and have a ton of pins.  
This is kind of a turn off, especially if you want to try prototyping.  I
 think one solution is something similar to your old Spartan 3E dev 
board.  A basic FPGA that can easily be integrated with a breadboard 
design.  Be sure to have a good interface to the PC though.  FPGAs don’t
 tend to come with USB drivers, so maybe an open source JTAG adapter or 
something would really help.</p>

<p>4) Tools.  I agree tools aren’t readily available, but I really don’t
 think anything can be done to fix that.  To build an FPGA image you are
 going to need the proprietary software from the manufacturer to map 
your logic into their device.  Perhaps the best thing here is to pick an
 FPGA which has freely available tools (I use Xilinx ISE for example) 
and work up a tutorial video that shows people how to do the basics, 
without worrying about details they don’t need to know.  For the more 
computer savy out there, don’t forget that most all of the tools can 
also be run at the command line with scripts.  That can make things a 
lot less painful.  Maybe provide a simple Makefile that will make 
compiling an FPGA as easy as typing ‘make’. Finally, for beginners maybe
 a simple development GUI to work with the code blocks I mentioned above
 could be written.  Something basic that would let you drag and drop 
circuit blocks and then export the code, or simply call the real tools 
from the command line in the background would make things a lot easier.</p>

<p>Just my 2 cents, not sure if they are worth that much or not.</p></div>

browse their site.  My recommendation is if you want to start teaching 
about FPGAs, work with them, they have done an incredible job with the 
Mojo.  I think they covered almost every hurdle I could think of, and a 
couple I had overlooked.</p></div>

<li>Very true. State Machines are really popular, but you can’t rule out the pipeline designs!</li>
<li>Schematic design after learning FSM can be difficult. Because you 
need to have your states generated in the schematic editor. For those 
“blocks”, OpenCores has them. The problem with OpenCores is the lack of 
documentation, and how to use them properly.. Xilinx has the IP 
Integrator in Vivado (can’t use with the Mojo or Papilio), but it allows
 you to do this.</li>
<li>The older generation of FPGAs are all SMD, but when you get to the 
newer/bigger chips, they are all BGA. FPGAs have a lot of IO pins.</li>
<li>I agree the proprietary tools ar ethe better way to go. I know 
Xilinx has “Quick Take” Videos which show you how to use Vivado (not 
sure on the ISE side). In reality, drawing up a schematic and block 
diagrams by hand and not in a computer will be just as effective as 
SketchUp.</li>
</ol>


<p>All valid points.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Something I found really fun was getting my
 papilio pro to talk to an old LVDS laptop panel. It’s a pretty easy 
project, at most you just need a power supply for the screen inverter, 
and you instantly have something to play with that would be 
hard/impossible with a normal processor. I found it much easier to “get”
 vhdl if I was using it to display patterns and graphics to the screen.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I studied Operations Research and some CS 
and my first few years in industry were as a programmer.  I got 
interested in electronics as a hobby about 2 years ago and developed 
some decent microcontroller skills, largely thanks to SparkFun.  A few 
months back, I decided that I wanted to see what all the FPGA buzz was 
about and I was lucky enough to get in on the ground floor with the Mojo
 as a kickstarter supporter.</p>

<p>I won’t say that it was easy - the shift in thinking from writing 
traditional code to designing ciruits in Verilog was headache-inducing 
at first, but the tutorials and example code on the EmbeddedMicro site 
really helped to illuminate things for me.  My first project was a 
simple scrolling display on an 8x8 LED matrix.  I’m not sure whether I 
did it “right”, but it works.  The 50 Mhz clock speed of the Mojo leaves
 plenty of cycles for PWM, scanning rows, and scrolling the text very 
smoothly and evenly.  I implemented a simple RAM block to hold the 
characters and a second block to hold the message.  My next step is to 
wire up a serial connection via the on-board microcontroller to display 
any message input on the serial port.</p>

<p>The Mojo takes a lot of the annoying logistics out of the way so that
 you can jump right in and start using the FPGA.  The tutorials walk you
 through getting the free ISE WebPack design software from Xilinx, and 
EmbeddedMicro provides a Loader program that uploads your finished .bin 
file to the microcontroller which “programs” the FPGA, all seamlessly.  I
 had Hello World (i.e. an LED tied to a button) up and running within 
minutes of getting the software stack installed.  I highly recommend the
 Mojo as a first step toward understanding and using FPGAs.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>If you want to learn how to design using 
FPGAs you could always have a crack at my informal FPGA course - 
http://hamsterworks.co.nz/mediawiki/index.php/FPGA_course. The learning 
curve is still quite steep - “Programming without loops? WTF!”, however 
it is a lot less steep than doing it alone.</p>

<p>You have to remember you are trying to make something useful out of 
half a million logic gates, and have it all work at tens or hundreds of 
megahertz. That would take the resources of a large company in the 80’s 
or 90’s….</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I worked with FPGAs in college and really 
enjoyed them.  They are great for tasks requiring memory like working 
with video.  I made a paint program with VGA output and touch screen 
input for one of my final projects.  It was a mix of schematic and 
verilog blocks, I liked the flexibility you got developing for them.  
They are very different animals than microcontrollers though, and I 
haven’t had the work opportunity to play with them since.  Those dev 
boards might be a good way to step back in.</p></div>

further than the Compact Rio from NI. Especially the low cost 
single-board RIO. It is dead easy to program using data-flow language 
(LabView) and the results are very powerful indeed. In fact a larger 
version of one of these is used at CERN on the Haldron collider! The one
 I have has 27 digital I/Os, 16 Analogue ADC inputs and 4 DAC outputs. 
If that doesn’t light your candle then nothing will.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I gave a power point presentation last 
night to our robotics club about FPGAs.  My big point was that it is not
 CPU vs FPGA, it is CPU + FPGA.  I have been around the industry for a 
lot of years at www.srccomputers.com, I have worked with both Xilinx and
 Altera  products.  At the moment, my preference is Altera tools and 
verilog language.  I have eval boards for both zynq7000 and Cyclone V ST
 right now and I love the SoC concept(these are similar offerings from 
both companies with ARM core plus programmable logic).  I am laying out a
 PCB for hobby UAV that uses the Cyclone V ST.  My tact is to show what 
the chip can do and what the cost is while developing ways to bring new 
people on board.  After giving some examples of what is possible with 
these new SoC devices, the last bullet says “These are more complex to 
work with, but I can teach you.”  And now we come full circle to the 
article, there are a lot of concepts to learn for FPGA design.  However,
 if a nice website builds on the curriculum then the core does not have 
to be completely hashed out with every new person.  In addition,  free 
FPGA classes can help with hands on learning.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I designed a 1Ghz logic analyzer with 
little more than an Altera FPGA and a serial port.  Try that with your 
latest processor of the day, I don’t care if you can program in CUDA and
 all that–FPGAs and processors are simply different tools for different 
jobs.</p>

<p>I designed an FPGA interface for the Raspberry Pi that uses direct 
writing of RPi GPIOs to achieve about a 16Megabyte/sec transfer time in C
 (don’t use the BCM2835 library functions, that will limit you to around
 2.5 Mbytes or less).  This overcomes some of the limitations of the RPi
 by putting in a precisely timed thread scheduler, touch panel HW, 64 
high current IOs, and an LVDS LCD panel interface in the FPGA.  I’m 
working on an FPGA design that will take HDMI signals (10 samples per 
clock) to LVDS video (7 samples per clock) so that the RPi video can be 
displayed on the panel.  None of these are practical things for a 
processor to do.  It’s a giant circuit sandbox, and the tools are 
getting better for makers.  I’ll brag a little and tell you I’ve been 
doing this since 1978, when I designed what could arguably be called the
 world’s first FPGA in college (I still have all the project data, and I
 got an A+!) using rectangles to draw out transistors.  Somebody said 
FPGAs are going away, I laughed, they are just now coming into their 
own…</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Texas Instruments was the company that 
paved the way–they were the true innovators.  Signetics, Intel, AMD, 
Motorola all were nascent in the new IC business as well.  Xilinx and 
Altera came along quite a bit later–it took a really long time for the 
configurable logic concept to be really workable.</p>

<p>I remember being so excited about the IC stuff anyone could buy for 
the first time–I was the only one in my high school of 3000 students 
doing anything in the IC electronics building area!  When I was in 
college, IC logic was available in increasing complexity, but the notion
 of configurable logic didn’t really exist as far as I knew–somehow I 
came up with the idea of reconfigurable logic (and hence my college IC 
project).  At the time, I’m sure others had ideas about configurable 
logic as well–but it took a very long time for the notion to become 
remotely as good in practice (as fast, as cheap, as reliable) as wiring 
up existing ICs.  I made an array of interconnected nand gates that were
 selectivly enabled by a small array of nand latches.  Depending on how 
you wrote the nand latches, you could alter the input to output function
 of the IC.  Pretty simple, but those were amazing times where you 
really could come up with ideas never been done before.</p>

<p>I knew several people that went on to be very successful in the tech 
business, but I had (and still don’t) no interest in money-making or 
business–I’ve just always loved making things, so I maybe had 
opportunities but never took them.  I’ve had a long and mostly 
comfortable career in logic and ASIC design, and that was good enough 
for me.</p>

<p>Getting back to the subject, FPGAs are the ultimate playground for 
somebody like me–processors can’t touch the flexibility of what can be 
done here.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>It sounds as if a microcontroller and FPGA 
are two diferent “launguages”. So what needs to be done is to allow a 
novice in electrical enginering experience FPGA’s before 
microcontrollers so they will easily become aclamated to it. This just 
as an American learning English and a Italian learning Italian because 
that is the “base” or “pedistal” that they grew and adapted from.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I think FPGAs are probably pretty scary to 
program, but then the only experience I have is that my high school 
electronics class did some stuff once with GALs which required boolean 
logic… ex. (A &amp;&amp; B &amp;&amp; !C) || (!A &amp;&amp; C) || !B 
That was terrifying painful, I couldn’t do it today even if I had the 
equipment although I think we did manage to make it work. Translating an
 idea into logic like that is a headache.</p>

<p>Hopefully it’s nothing like that. I suspect one big barrier is that 
you need to know a lot about logic beforehand and have a good grasp of 
that and how to reduce ideas to logic.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I bought a DLP-FPGA USB Xilinx 3E-based FPGA Module with a very nice instruction manual from <a href="http://www.dlpdesign.com/fpga/fpga.shtml">DLP Design</a>
 and followed their tutorials. Worked for me. The folks at DLP were very
 good in answering all the questions I had. The board is fitted with an 
FTDI part with 2 logical USB ports which means that you can create some 
VHDL (I’ve never tried Verilog) to send logged data back to a host PC 
and also program the FPGA via a single USB cable. I also used the high 
speed version of the board which is fitted with 32Mbytes SDRAM. Learning
 how to create a memory controller block using the Xilinx ISE wizard 
took a lot of time but was well worth it. I eventually used the module, 
with the SDRAM acting as a frame buffer, in a battery-powered design to 
control the backplane of a custom-built LCD.</p>

<p>FPGAs are <strong>very</strong> different beasts to the MCU’s on 
Arduino’s and require a whole different mindset before you can start 
getting to grips with them. They are definitely not suitable for 
“whack-it-in” engineering prototype tasks like the Arduino is.</p></div>

<li>Start with why FPGA’s are needed from a practical sense.  That means
 compare them to devices like some of the common PIC and Atmel families 
that have some juice.</li>
<li>Build upon item 1 by showing what you can’t do or what you can do 
better with a FPGA version of the common DIY boards such as the 
Arduinos, Beagles, and some of the PIC versions.</li>
<li>Take a common but complex project that is done with an Arduino, 
break it down into high level blocks and those into lower level blocks. 
 Then do the same for how the FPGA'er would tackle the same task.</li>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I ordered a guzunty (Google it) which is a 
CPLD board which attaches to a Raspberry Pi.  (Still waiting on shipping
 to deliver; ~$25 US including shipping from the UK)</p>

<p>CPLDs are like small FPGAs (hundreds of gates instead of millions) and are also programmed with VHDL or Verilog.</p>

<p>The Pi attachment means that I can do most stuff with Python on the 
Pi, and do appropriate things with VHDL on the CPLD.  (e.g. I could 
write a stepper motor controller with ramp-up/ramp-down acceleration for
 the CPLD that responds to register values sent by the Pi and not have 
to worry that Linux is not a real-time OS that can’t do the pulse timing
 properly.)</p>

<p>Sparkfun doesn’t sell any CPLDs, but breakout boards are available 
from other vendors if you don’t want to go the Guzunty Pi route.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>CPLDs are nice, and a lot of the smaller 
FPGA companies (Lattice, Microsemi, etc) still make CPLDs because it’s a
 market they do really well in.</p>

<p>The biggest difference between CPLDs and FPGAs (besides their size) 
is their on-chip features. FPGAs have BRAMs/DSPs/ADC/Gigabit 
Transceivers. CPLDs are more LUTs, flip-flops, I/O, and maybe some more 
little nick-nack features.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I have never tried to ‘program’ an FPGA, 
but I did just learn how to program a PLC in ladder logic.  I have 
programmed many things in basic like languages for years as well as 
programmed ucontrollers for several projects.  The shift to programming a
 machine in ladder logic was fairly big.  You can have several parallel 
process running and it ‘seemed’ much more difficult to “control” what 
was going on.  As I learned more and more, I found that it was much 
easier to add certain types of functionality with ladder logic since I 
knew that bit of ‘code’ would alwys run regardless of what else was 
going on in the ‘program’</p>

<p>Bottom line is that ladder logic (similar to what I understand about 
VHDL, etc.) IS a pictorial view of hardware that used to exist as 
switches and relays.  I’m not sure of the hardware used inside a PLC, 
but the implementation of programming it is very different from 
traditional line by line code.  Some may call it BAD, but I just call it
 ‘different’.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I agree that a lot of people try to get 
into FPGAs thinking that they are just supped up microcontrollers and 
that is simply not the case.  They are far closer to a cpld (complex 
programmable logic device) than they are to a microcontroller.</p>

<p>I find that the way I solve problems is much more in line with VHDL 
than with a traditional procedural language.  I recently wrote a pong 
game on an FPGA for school and I found that while it was harder than 
doing it in Python or something like that, I liked how I could solve the
 problem more.  On a processor I have to worry about when I do each 
thing and if I have enough clock cycles to get through the gameplay math
 so I can update the visuals.  On an FPGA I can solve each issue 
independently.  I can make some signals that represent the players and 
then write a different bit of code that continually displays them and 
another that moves them.  They all get synthisized to separate logic 
circuits that inherently run all the time.  Think of it like building a 
circuit with code.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>When I first started using FPGA’s in 1992, 
using VHDL was an expensive alternative.  Using schematic capture was 
the way I originally chose to enter in designs.  Xilinx had a program 
that would translate the netlists and then would route the fpga from 
that.  It was kind of funny, back then it took close to 45 minutes to 
route a 3,000 gate fpga. (XC4003).  I used this method until about 2002,
 when I switched to Verilog.  For me, the transition was fairly easy.  I
 thought of the verilog more as a verbal description of a schematic 
rather than a programming language.  I also do a lot of programming in 
C/C++, but I have always been able to keep my mindset for these two 
activities separate.</p>

<p>By the way, is Sparkfun going to carry the Mojo?  I at the very least would find this a very handy board.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I’d be curious to know more about the 
relationship between FPGAs and ASICs.  I mean, I know what they are and 
such, but never having designed either I’m curious how they relate.</p>

<p>Specifically, ASICs have been getting a lot of press in the Bitcoin 
world of late, and I’ve heard that one approach to designing an ASIC is 
first to implement the design in an FPGA and then migrate that same 
design to the ASIC.  The idea that the two technologies would use the 
same description language is something I had not considered.  It seems 
plausible, and if this is really the way it’s done then it makes 
learning FPGA design a lot more attractive to me personally.</p>

<p>Plus that Mojo board is dead sexy, so there’s that.</p></div>

 to have good scripts which perform automaticaly the

converting the RTL in a bitstream ready to be send to the FPGA, and it’s
 can be hard to achieve when you start learning. Further works on tool

 component library (counter, ALU, …) ?</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>And as far as the verilog/vhdl side there 
are free tools out there that run on linux and windows that any one can 
dive in and start using.  Understanding that you dont need to see an 
actual led light (or actual smoke come out of the part) to learn 
something, you can do huge, complicated designs, just like the 
professionals do it.  That last step of taking your design to silicon 
has a learning curve sure, but you can divide those learning experiences
 up on these natural boundaries.  I have been working in the silicon 
industry for years and along with the pay-for tools we use the free 
tools quite a bit (verilator and icarus and gtkwave), as we do our 
software development on chip/board simulators so that when silicon 
arrives we are mostly ready to go.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Very true! If you just to learn the basics 
of digital logic and HDL, open source is the way to go. My only concern 
with open source for HDL is the lack of supportability. For example, 
someone is learning HDL and they see they can do a neat little trick to 
do what they want. When they push it through the open source compilers, 
it doesn’t work. It is very hard to keep compilers on top of the 
language standards out there, and I commend anyone on the open source 
tools to keep it up.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I dont see the logic is all that hard, 
counting from 0 to 1, AND, OR, NOT covers about 99% of it.  The tools 
are proprietary and generally not at the quality of the equivalent 
software toolchains.  That is a major barrier to entry for software 
folks to transfer over.  xilinx or someone did a study back when 
languages were taking over schematic capture, and software folks were 
preferred over electrical engineers for doing logic design because all 
you had to teach them was the concept of things happening in parallel, 
they already knew programming languages and compilers and other similar 
tools.  Today of course that is different.  If someone were brave enough
 to make a programmable device where the guts of it, were open such that
 the open source community could make the compiler and place and route, 
etc, you would eventually see tools that dont suck, run everywhere, and 
overall better experience.</p>

<p>The real reasong for adding a coment though is that if you go over 
and look at what xmos.com has, which wants to be competition for cpld 
and small fpgas, that may or may not be a good stepping stone for 
software folks that want to do more than just bit bang some gpios.  not 
the same languages, sure, C and asm instead of verilog and vhdl, not the
 same experience necessarily as pure logic, but the experience of 
understanding the signals you want to send or receive, using a simulator
 that provides waveforms that you use gtkwave or something with, that is
 all the same experience as with cplds and fpgas.</p></div>

<ol>
<li>Chip design and layout is very tough, time consuming, and very 
expensive. (Typical tapeouts of chips go for a few million dollars).</li>
<li>Place and Route algorithms come in all shapes in sizes. So when you 
start adding in the hundreds of variables of how to do it on a chip, it 
makes it very difficult.</li>
<li>Process nodes (110nm, 90nm 60nm, 45nm, etc) are being phased out and a lot of fabs are retiring from doing specific nodes.</li>
</ol>


<p>With these three thoughts, could someone open source it and let 
people make it? Sure, but it’ll take a lot of capital and a lot of work 
to get something out there where they don’t see a dime! I will fully 
support anyone who wants to do this, just know the obstacles.</p>

<p>The best implementation I saw of an open source FPGA was multiple 
chips. One board of this design was one SLICE of an FPGA. As for the 
software programmers need not to learn the hardware. I have to say, they
 need to learn the guts in order to get the solution they want.</p></div>

 of you in the know) in a high school and FPGA boards comprise part of 
the course.  We don’t get into the HDL much at all, which is 
auto-generated from their logic designs in Multisim.  I have them look 
at the VHDL a little, however, which helps them to appreciate what 
brings their simulated circuits to life on actual hardware.  I think 
this is a great entry into this great world of FPGA development, and I 
believe NI has a 30-day trial version of Multisim as well.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Good on you for teaching a value set of skills to a device that gets no attention until late in everyone’s college career.</p>

<p>May I suggest a way to help introduce HDL into learning?</p>

<p>Relate HDL code to the digital logic circuits they’re building. With 
this, you can apply syntax of HDL as an afterthought and the kids should
 understand the do’s and dont’s of HDL. If you can say, “See this 
counter we built with logic devices? Let’s code it using HDL for an FPGA
 and see if the results we get are the same.”</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I’m in the same boat as many…  FPGAs are 
all over, but I don’t really fully understand them.  Ironically, I use 
them constantly!  And, my case is probably a good example of how they 
are becoming pervasive while removing the difficulties in implementing 
them…</p>

<p>You see, I use National Instruments Compact RIO controllers for 
specific control applications, as very high speed replacements to old 
PLC technology.  The interesting thing in the cRIO is that it has an 
FPGA backplane built into the unit, which you can directly access and 
leverage when programming in LabVIEW.  So, I can take my LabVIEW 
program, pick specific routines or code that would benefit from running 
at FPGA speeds (and experiencing true parallelism for execution), and 
just make a few conscious tweaks or planned adjustments while creating 
the code.  When I deploy my code into the controller, it handles all of 
the direct programming and configuration of the FPGA, and I don’t have 
to think about it.  It’s like some kind of cyber-magic…  And the speed 
bump in the processor that I get by pulling those functions out of the 
CPU and right into the FPGA can be amazing!</p>

<p>I think, if more and more programming and development platforms can 
make it easy and seamless to integrated FPGAs, they will continue to 
grow and become even more pervasive.  Sometimes, the trick is to just 
make tools to let people use them, without having to understand them.  I
 mean, how many people actually know how a computer CPU works, vs how 
many people use one every day?  Or how many circuit or board designers 
know the specifics of how every chip they are using works, as opposed to
 just knowing the functionality and general specs?  It may be that a 
little less hardcore understanding of the intricacies of FPGA and a 
little more “ignorance is bliss” could make many lives so much easier…  
Heh</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Valid points.</p>

<p>But the thing is, FPGAs are used in extremely complex designs, which 
requires a lot of very specific knowledge of EE concepts. The thing that
 the Mojo and Papilio do is get a cheap DIY system into the hands of 
people willing and wanting to learn.</p>

<p>As stated in one of my comments, the best way to learn the FPGA is to
 learn the building blocks (AND/OR/NOR/NAND/XOR/etc. gates, Flip-flops, 
LUTs, etc.). After you understand the basics, if you can translate those
 to HDL. This way you have a 1:1 mapping on the code. From here, there 
are two things you can do: 1) Learn the features of the FPGA (very 
advanced), or 2) Learn the tool chains used to program the chips. I 
would recommend 2. This gives you the best ability to understand how to 
fully utilize the FPGA.</p>

<p>I will be more than happy to do livestream on demand for anyone who wants to learn.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Yep, FGPA’s are hard.  You are working at 
the absolute lowest level of computing hardware possible.  It is 
equivalent to connecting 74LSxx parts with jumper wires on a bread 
board.  Add to that the fact that timing matters immensely and you have a
 complex, and difficult to learn environment.  Learn async digital 
logic.  Learn synchronous digital logic.  Work your way up the ladder.  
When you understand why most FOR loops in Verilog cannot be synthesized,
 then start more complex stuff.  Sometimes concepts are hard for a 
reason and not everybody gets them.  That’s ok.  Sometimes, something 
that looks cool takes a lot of work, maybe more work than you want to 
put into it.  That’s ok too.  In reality, if you are looking for high 
level programming constructs to put down large blocks of functionality 
on an FPGA, you don’t don’t need and FPGA.  You need a microcontroller.</p></div>

<p>As a comment to the for loop. HDL supports for loops, but not the way
 you think. They are usually used in “generate blocks” which basically 
means, the for loop is used to generate blocks of hardware to use in the
 design. So you want to generate 50 flip-flops? Write an HDL for loop.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I am a software engineer, with a master in CS. I am dabbling in electronics as a hobby.</p>

<p>Understanding the “non-procedural” part of programming FPGAs is not 
all that tricky - if you have used languages such as Haskell or Prolog 
and encountered declarative programming during the computer science 
education, you would be right at home with Verilog or VHDL. 
Unfortunately a lot of software engineers didn’t have these things at 
the university, not to mention people who learn a bit of Javascript or 
PHP and think themselves programmers …</p>

<p>I think the worst thing someone can do trying to teach/learn programmable logic to software people is to:
a) say it is programming
b) say that Verilog is similar to C</p>

<p>Neither is true in the way software engineers understand these terms 
and it sets the stage up for a major problem with due to not speaking 
the same language.</p>

<p>It is similar thing like programmable voltage references - it took me
 a while to realize that “programming” them actually means soldering one
 or two resistors! Software engineer thinks programming = source 
code/compilers/execution flow and the confusion happens right there 
before even getting to the substance of the discussion.</p>

I’ve worked in HLS companies for the past 5 years, and am well aware of 
the various solutions on the market, as well as the history of companies
 that didn’t make it. HLS is no where near “solved”, and especially not 
by Vivado. The biggest strength of Vivado’s HLS is integration with 
backend synthesis and the rest of the toolchain. Yah, thats a huge deal,
 and it will probably be the HLS of choice for plenty of people for that
 reason. But its not really an amazing HLS solution, its a decent one 
that cleanly integrates into the tool chain that most people use.</p></div>

<p>FPGAs are really in their own world. You know the telecommunications 
network people love and enjoy? Routers/switches/backhaul stations on 
cell towers, all use FPGAs. Cool huh? They are also used in video 
displays. The reason is, it’s easier to build a VGA/HDMI/DVI system in 
an FPGA than ASIC (plus cheaper too). Your external harddrives for 
backups? They’re there too (not so much anymore).</p>

<p>GPU companies use FPGAs to model their GPU processes in order to optimize their designs. Same goes with the CPU companies…</p>

<p>As an “Oh My Fact,” Google uses FPGAs to process the Google Street 
View images. By utilizing their protobufs they can decode the data fast 
and give it to you fast. Pretty slick, huh?</p>

<p>I can go one, but then I’d end up ranting…</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Not really, they are different than microcontrollers.</p>

<p>It’s hard to explain well, but think of an FPGA as having 
programmable logic gates which can be configured in different ways to 
fit its task.  It actually does this by converting your logic into look 
up tables.  Most tasks run almost in parallel, with gate delays, and 
anything procedural must be created and written a specific way to use 
clocks and edges and blocking calls to force things to run line by line.</p>

<p>A microprocessor has a core that is expecting commands and it acts on
 those.  So you program a huge list of commands, your program, and the 
micro steps through line by line evaluating and doing actions on that 
code.</p>

<p>They are different enough and both have their specific purposes so 
much so that they make FPGA’s that have micros on board, either soft 
cores, a virtual micro made from gates, or even some hard cores.  I 
think Xilinx makes a core with an ARM on board.</p>

<p>I prefer micros for my day to day tasks, where FPGA’s really shine 
for me is things that are memory intensives such as video and picture 
work.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Exactly. Plus you can always reprogram them to do something different.</p>

<p>To give a good example, look at the autonomous vehicle competition. 
You have a microcontroller handle GPS, motor control, sensors, etc. 
That’s really fast (16MHz or about). Doing interrupts on the MCU does 
take away from the speed (a bit), but it’s generally fast.</p>

<p>Now if you did the same thing on an FPGA, you can parallelize the 
process. So instead of all the data going to one system for handling, 
you can have GPS data work with the sensors and send control signals to 
the motors as necessary. I’ve been dabbling when I can on my <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/news/www.zedboard.org">zedboard</a>.
 It’s an ARM processor + FPGA. I really wanted to do AVC with it. ARM is
 loaded with linux that is running a constant python/perl/C/C++ 
script/program to gather GPS data, display it to the onboard OLED, and 
send control signal commands to the FPGA (which would do just PWM). I 
knew this was too easy, so, why not process digital video from a GoPro 
and broadcast it via an ad-hoc network?</p>

<p>Pretty slick, huh?</p>

<p>Another example is if you want to do some audio filtering. Most 
people would use DSPs directly to do this, but those are expensive. With
 an FPGA, you can take in the audio (ADC) do your filtering and output 
it to a DAC. It reminds me of  a design someone did. They built an 
Arduino inside a Spartan3 to control LEDs</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>One way to think about it is to consider where FPGAs came from.  They basically started with the <a href="http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc0778.pdf">GAL</a>
 technology where you could put a bunch of gates on a single chip and 
then program it for the functionality you needed.  I used a 22V10 that 
way on a crowded board that needed a bunch of simple “and” and “or” 
functionality to reconfigure an address bus based on a logic input.  I 
really liked that little chip, it replaced a half-dozen other chips that
 wouldn’t have fit.  Even better, I could re-program it when our needs 
changed - much easier than unsoldering a bunch of chips!  That 
technology led to PLD, then CPLD, then FPGA.  They all have the same 
basic mindset - a (huge) toolbox of parts you can connect together 
programmatically to implement pretty much whatever logic function you 
want.  One big use for them is when you need to chew through a lot of 
data <em>fast</em>.  A microprocessor running a program can only operate
 on a few pieces of data at a time, one after another.  An FPGA can 
“drink from the firehose” and keep up.  It’s like the speed of a 
dedicated hardware implementation, combined with the small size and 
flexibility of a CPU.  Happily, even though Lattice discontinued their 
original 22V10, the Atmel one I referenced above is still in production -
 and available in a breadboard-friendly DIP package!  At less than two 
and a half bucks (quantity 1 from Digikey, ATF22V10C-15PU-ND), they’re 
affordable enough to just get one and play with it.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I have been dealing with the big expensive 
mess left by an embedded use of 2 FPGA’s.  For most uses the best thing 
to do is dedicate a micro-processor to the job.  This is in fact what 
ARM has done with its multicore ARM chips.  You dedicate a job to a 
processor matched to the job and do only high level decisions on the 
basic machine.   The concept of FPGA is for the most part obsolete. The 
support from the Manufacturers SUCKS and BLOWS CHUNKS.  The FPGA market 
has essentially topped out and is set for a long and miserable death.</p>

<p>The only exception to FPGA being a rotten idea is where you need a 
lot of very high speed computing where many complex computations need to
 be done to drive a process in single clock cycles.  The hot shot 
processors of today such as ARM processers have pretty well doomed even 
this area to death.  Imagine a FPGA able to compete against a very 
highly parallel processor.  It doesn’t work.</p>

<p>The reason computing is so strange is few people consider that there 
can be a whole lot of processes going on in an FPGA at the same time.  
It sort of is a multi-core processor.  I know that there are more 
details but it isn’t really any different.   With the birth of the Quad 
Core and above ARM chips  (Think Parallella.org) this advantage is gone.
  You always will have to deal with concurency in any machine where more
 than one process is going on at a time.  This works like interrupts.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>No, you are missing the point. The FPGA is 
hardware and as such can outperform a precessor with speeds of up to 100
 times faster (depending on the application fo course). It can work 
concurrently of course too. The support and documentation I agree is 
terrible and that is why you need a Compact Rio.</p></div>

<p>I hope you get a chance to work with FPGAs in a better setting some

them as 100,000+ core CPUs running Finite State Machines rather than

<div class="comment-text"><p>Perhaps you want to do high-speed digital 
data acquisition (100MHz+), or DSP filtering of RF signals, or maybe 
extracting audio from HDMI streams, or how about processing 1080p video 
streams in real time, or processing raw video from cameras for embedded 
vision, or controlling 64 servos in real time, or filter a 3Mb/s S/PDIF 
stream.</p>

<p>The low latency (measured in nanoseconds) and ease of interfacing 
allow FPGAs to do things that can not be done with CPUs, even when 
running a real time OS.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>The issue you describe is very odd, which 
makes me wonder if it was someone who wanted to use an FPGA without the 
proper research.</p>

<p>As for your comments on that it’s a failing area due to quadcores and
 multi-cored ASICs/ASSPs. You are sadly wrong. Why would I want to spend
 5 milllion dollars on tapeout of an ASIC/ASSP to do video integration 
into a system? Why would I limit my system to just running that process?
 Let’s look at the Internet traffic of today. That’s a lot of 
processing. Pushing that data through a pipeline (like you’re suggesting
 in a CPU system), you’re wasting a minimum of 4 cycles per packet (at 
best). With an FPGA, you can process that data just as fast, and have no
 overhead. Not only that, but you can parallelize the data stream! 
Xilinx’s 28G transceivers are used in parallel for backhaul. So if you 
have 16x28G processing packets (16 in parallel), you’re out performing a
 multi-cored system by gigaflops.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I think one of the biggest problems is a 
lack of good free tooling and allowances for “emulation”.  I mean, 
waveforms are useful, but they are part of that learning curve I think. 
For good free tooling, there just isn’t much there. You can cobble 
together an environment using ghdl, make, and gtkwave, but it’s not 
easy. Another big complaint is that VHDL and Verilog are both such 
terrible languages. Verilog lets you do crazy procedural stuff that’s 
not synthesizable(but not obvious) and VHDL is so verbose and 
inconsistent it’s painful. There are some attempts to fix this, such as 
pyhdl that translates to VHDL, but it’s not perfect, and there is a huge
 lack of documentation for newbies if you go that route. Also, there is 
absolutely no free tool I’ve seen for debugging any HDL code, especially
 when it works in simulation, but not in hardware. I think a lot more 
has to happen than writing good documentation to make FPGAs easy to use.
 It boils down to better tooling and letting newbies be able to use 
simpler tools than a waveform viewer and testbench code</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>FPGA design software (for Xilinx and Altera
 mostly) they have free versions of their software. The Mojo and 
Papilios use parts that are in the ISE WebPACK version, so you don’t 
need to buy anything to program the chips!</p>

<p>I disagree with the VHDL and Verilog being terrible languages. Not to
 insult you, but it tells me that you did not learn them well, or 
understand what they do. The FPGA and ASIC community uses these 
languages very heavily (especially Verilog). If you want to take 
existing code and convert it, Xilinx has Vivado HLS which will take 
C/C++/SystemC code and convert it to Verilog/VHDL for you.</p>

<p>For debugging code, Altera and Xilinx both offer free software that 
lets you do this. The open source area of debugging HDL is not there 
(nor should it be), because once you have HDL written, what do you do 
with it? It makes no sense to write HDL and not push it to a chip.</p>

<p>I disagree that it comes down to simpler tools. It comes down to the 
teaching. FPGAs are always going to be complicated, and will get more-so
 as time goes on. it’s a matter of teaching it the right way.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Not to insult you, but if you think that 
VHDL and Verilog are good languages, then you don’t know much about 
language design. They are terrible. The number of times I’ve tracked 
down a verilog bug to “oops accidentally misspelled a wire’s name, why 
didn’t I get warned about this instead of the synthesis just silently 
assuming I wanted a completely new wire?” really makes me mad. The 
verbosity of VHDL is practically legendary. I won’t disagree that they 
aren’t used heavily in the real world, but that is hardly evidence that 
they are good languages.</p></div>

<p>Luckily, compilers now are able to catch this (if you don’t

<div class="comment-text"><p>One of the big confusions that people have 
to keep in mind about VHDL is that unlike most “programming languages”, 
it’s not really designed for computers to parse. It’s more designed as a
 description language for documentation (for humans, or at least 
engineers) to read.</p>

<p>At some point, computers got powerful enough for a subset of VHDL to 
be synthesizable, but at the core - the verbosity comes from the fact 
that humans and not computers were the original parsers of VHDL.</p></div>

for abotu 12 years, as well as being his boss for several. From my 
perspective, it is true, you can do some VERY tricky stuff on FPGA’s. 
This has been for a high end video grabber with different compression 
codec onboard. We max the capacity, and have several different builds 
for different functionality that we load on the fly. Over the years, we 
have had many issues with tools, we get a new release to fix one issue, 
discover another. Due to the nature of the product, we have to do a lot 
of non automated testing, and we have often found one build that works 
and other builds that don’t due to, and this may not be correct, 
automated gate routing that gives unequal length gate routes to memory, 
causing timing issues when accessing SRAM. Of course, since I’m not the 
engineer, I don’t have a reliable estimation of how much is engineer and
  how much is tools :) Either way, we couldn’t do what we do without 
them, but boy are they a man power hog !</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Totally understand. It’s tough to make a 
tool that is always worked on reliable release-to-release and have it 
not break customer designs. Most customers will find a good build and 
use it until they have to get a new chip for their next product.</p>

<p>Luckily (I don’t know about Altera), but I know Xilinx has done a lot
 to create good documentation and teaching for customers/users.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Well, I’ve made some small projects and my 
workflow was quite painful. Using ghdl/gtkwave for development and then 
when I need to actually “deploy” to the FPGA, copying everything into 
ISE (because using only ISE webpack itself, was even more painful). And 
my argument is that VHDL/Verilog sucks as languages in general. I don’t 
want to try to describe hardware in C++, I just hate how verbose and 
old-fashioned they seem to be. But yea, I’m no expert, but for my own 
personal learning curve, VHDL and Verilog (I chose VHDL, but tried 
Verilog a bit as well) about 25% of my learning difficulties. 25% being 
lack of good tooling. 50% being the fundamental paradigm shift that 
you’re /describing/ hardware, not programming hardware.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I totally get where you’re coming from.</p>

<p>I think if you had a good teacher or way to apply what FPGAs can do, I think you’d enjoy it.</p>

<p>As I stated down below, I’m in the #sparkfun IRC channel all the 
time, and I’m helping out someone with FPGA development. I do 
livestreams on demand, so if you want to, I can teach you some of the 
tools of ISE WebPACK and HDL coding (mostly in Verilog).</p></div>
